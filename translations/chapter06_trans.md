| `## 確率の考え方と使い所` | `## Understanding and Applications of Probability` |
| `統計と確率は密接な関係がある。` | `Statistics and probability have a close relationship.` |
| `まずデータをたくさん集めると，個々のケースでは見られない全体的な傾向が見られるようになり，それを表現するのに確率の考え方を使う，というのがひとつ。` | `One point is that when you gather a lot of data, you can see overall trends that are not visible in individual cases, and you use the concept of probability to express that.` |
| `次にデータがそれほどたくさんなくとも，大きな全体の中から一部を取り出した標本Sampleと考えられるとき，標本は全体の性質をどのように反映しているかを考えることになる。ここで全体の傾向から一部を取り出した偶然性を表現するときに確率の考え方を使うことになる。` | `Even when there is not much data, when a part is taken out from a large whole and considered a sample, we think about how the sample reflects the properties of the whole. Here, when expressing the chance of taking a part from the overall trend, we will use the concept of probability.` |
| `最後に，理論的・原理的に挙動がわかっている機械のようなものでも，現実的・実践的には系統だったズレが生じたり，偶然としか考えられない誤差が紛れ込むことがある。前者は機械の調整で対応できるが，後者は偶然が従う確率を考える必要がある。` | `Finally, even with machines whose behavior is understood theoretically and fundamentally, practical and actual systematic deviations may occur, and random errors that can only be considered as accidental may creep in. The former can be handled by adjusting the machine, but the latter requires consideration of the probability that chance follows.` |
| `心理学は人間を対象に研究を行うが，あらゆる人間を一度に調べるわけにはいかないので，サンプルを取り出して調査したり実験したりする(第2のケース)。データサイエンスでは何万レコードというおおきなデータセットになるが，心理学の場合は数件から数十件しかないことも多い。また，心理学的傾向を理論立ててモデル化できたとしても，実際の行動には誤差が含まれている可能性が高い(第3のケース)。このことから，心理学で得られるデータは確率変数として考えられ，小標本から母集団の性質を推測する**推測統計**と共に利用される。` | `Psychology conducts research on humans, but because one cannot investigate all humans at once, one extracts samples and conducts surveys or experiments (the second case). In data science, the data set can contain tens of thousands of records, but in psychology, it is often only a few to several dozen. Furthermore, even if we could theoretically model psychological tendencies, there is a high possibility that actual behavior contains errors (the third case). From these circumstances, the data obtained in psychology can be considered a random variable, and it is used with **inferential statistics**, which infers the properties of the population from small samples.` |
| `厳密に数学的な意味での**確率**は，集合，積分，測度といった緻密な概念の積み重ねから定義される[^6.1]。ここではその詳細に分け入らず，単に「特定の結果が生じる可能性について，0から1の間の実数でその大小を表現したもの」とだけ理解しておいて欲しい。この定義からは，「全ての可能な組み合わせのうち当該事象の成立する割合」という解釈も成り立つし，「主観的に重みづけた真実味の強さに関する信念の度合い」という解釈も成り立つ。[^6.2]` | `In a strict mathematical sense, **probability** is defined by a buildup of intricate concepts such as sets, integrals, and measures[^6.1]. Here, rather than getting into the details, it would be sufficient to understand it simply as "something that expresses the magnitude of the possibility of a specific result occurring, with a real number between 0 and 1". From this definition, it could be interpreted as the "ratio of the occurrence of the event among all possible combinations", as well as the "degree of belief about the strength of truthfulness weighed subjectively"[^6.2].` |
| `これまで学んできた確率は順列・組み合わせを全て書き出す退屈なもの，と思っていたかもしれないが，「十中八九まちがいないね(80-90%ほど確からしいと考えている)」という数字も確率の一種として扱えるので，非常に身近で適用範囲の広い概念である。理解を進めるポイントの1つとして，確率を面積として考えると良いかもしれない。ありうる状況の全体の空間に対して，事象の成立する程度がどの程度の面積がどの程度の割合であるかを表現したのが確率という量である，と考えるのである( @Hiraoka200910 は書籍の中で一貫して面積で説明している。この説明だと，条件付き確率などの理解がしやすい。)。` | `You may have thought that the probability you've learned so far is boring, as it involves writing out all the permutations and combinations, but numbers like "it's almost certainly wrong (thinking that it's about 80-90% sure)" can also be treated as a type of probability, making it a very familiar concept with a wide range of applications. One point to advance your understanding is that you may want to consider probability in terms of area. The concept is to think of probability as a measurement that expresses to what extent the occurrence of an event occupies a proportion of the total space of all possible situations (@Hiraoka200910 consistently explains this in his book. This explanation makes it easier to understand conditional probabilities and so on).` |
| `[^6.1]: 詳しくは @Yoshida2021-02-25 , @Kono1999-05-01, @Sato1994-02-25 などを参照のこと。` | `For more details, please refer to @Yoshida2021-02-25, @Kono1999-05-01, @Sato1994-02-25, etc.` |
| `[^6.2]: 前者の解釈は高校までの数学で学ぶ確率であり，頻度主義的確率と呼ばれることがある。一方後者の解釈は，降水確率X%のように日常でも使うものであり，主観確率と呼ばれることがある。こうした解釈の違いを，主義主張の対立であって数学的ではない，と批判する向きもあるが，実際コルモゴロフの公理はどちらの立場でも成立するように整えられており，筆者個人的にはユーザが理解しやすく計算できればどちらでも良いと考えている。` | `The former interpretation is the probability learned in mathematics up to high school, and it is sometimes called frequency probability. On the other hand, the latter interpretation is often used in everyday life, such as a precipitation probability of X%, and it can be referred to as subjective probability. While some may argue that these differences in interpretation are not mathematical but differences in belief, in reality, Kolmogorov's axioms have been arranged to apply to both views. Personally, the author believes that either is fine as long as it is easy for users to understand and calculate.` |
| `ただし注意して区別しておいて欲しいのが，確率変数とその実現値の違いである。データセットやスプレッドシートに含まれる値は，あくまでも**確率変数の実現値**というのであって，**確率変数**はその不確実な状態を有した変数そのものを指す言葉である。サイコロは確率変数だが，サイコロの出目は確率変数の実現値である。心理変数は確率変数だが，手に入れたデータはその実現値である。実現値を通じて変数の特徴を知り，全体を推測するという流れである。` | `However, what I would like you to carefully distinguish is the difference between a random variable and its realized value. The values contained in a dataset or spreadsheet are ultimately the realized values of a random variable, and a random variable is a term that refers to the variable itself in its uncertain state. A die is a random variable, but the outcome of a dice roll is the realized value of a random variable. A psychological variable is a random variable, but the data obtained is its realized value. The process involves understanding the characteristics of the variable through its realized values and making inferences about the whole.` |
| `目の前のデータを超えて，抽象的な実体で議論を進めることが難しく感じられるかもしれない。実は誰しもそうなのであって，確率の正確な理解は非常に難易度が高い。しかしRなど計算機言語に実装されている関数を通じて，より具体的に，操作しながら理解することで徐々に理解していこう。` | `You may feel it is difficult to proceed with discussions on abstract entities beyond the data in front of you. In fact, this is true for everyone, and understanding probability accurately is very difficult. However, through functions implemented in computer languages such as R, let's gradually understand by operating more concretely.` |
| `## 確率分布の関数` | `## Probability Distribution Function` |
| `確率変数の実現値は，**確率分布**に従う。確率分布とは，その実現値がどの程度生じやすいかを全て表した総覧であり，一般的に関数で表現される。実現値が連続的か離散的かによって名称が異なるが，連続的な確率分布関数は**確率密度関数(Probability Density Function)**，離散的な確率分布関数は**確率質量関数(Probability Mass Function)**という。` | `The realized values of a random variable follow a **probability distribution**. A probability distribution is a comprehensive overview that represents how likely each value is to occur, and it is generally expressed as a function. The name varies depending on whether the values are continuous or discrete, but the continuous probability distribution function is called **probability density function**, while the discrete probability distribution function is called **probability mass function**.` |
| `Rには最初から確率に関する関数がいくつか準備されている。最も有名な確率分布である**正規分布**について，次のような関数がある。` | `Several functions related to probability are prepared in R from the beginning. For the most famous probability distribution, the **normal distribution**, there are functions like the following.` |

In this way, in R, function is made up of a name representing a probability distribution (here it is `norm`) and a prefix single letter (`d`). This prefix letter includes `p`,`q`, and `r`. They are used like `dpois` (probability density function of Poisson distribution), `pnorm` (cumulative distribution function of normal distribution), `rbinom` (random number generation from binomial distribution).` |

| `乱数とは何であるかを説明するのは，「ランダムである(確率変数である)とは如何なることか」を説明するのと同じように難しい。` | `Explaining what a random number is as difficult as explaining what it means to be random (a random variable).` |
| `カンタンに説明するなら，規則性のない数列という意味である。` | `To put it simply, it means a sequence of numbers without regularity.` |
| `しかし計算機はアルゴリズムに沿って正しく数値を計算するものだから，ランダムに，規則性がない数字を示すということは厳密にはあり得ない。` | `However, since computers calculate numbers correctly according to algorithms, strictly speaking, they cannot generate random numbers without any rules.` |
| `計算機が出す乱数は，乱数生成アルゴリズムに沿って出される数字であり，ランダムに見えて実は規則性があるので，疑似乱数というのが正しい。` | `The numbers generated by a computer's random number generator are actually produced according to a random number generating algorithm. Although they appear random, they actually have a pattern, so it is more accurate to call them pseudorandom numbers.` |
| `とはいえ，人間が適当な数字を思いつきで誦じていく[^6.3]よりは，よほど規則性がない数列を出すので，疑似的とはいえ十分に役に立つ。` | `However, it is much more effective to generate a sequence of numbers with no particular pattern than for a human to recite arbitrary numbers off the top of their head[^6.3], and while it may only be pseudo, it is still very useful.` |
| `たとえばアプリなどで「ガチャ」を引くというのは，内部で乱数によって数値を出し，それに基づいてあたり・ハズレ等の判定をしている。他にも，RPGなどで攻撃する時に一定の確率で失敗するとか，一定の確率で「会心の一撃」を出すというのも同様である。ここで大事なのは，そうしたゲームへの実装において規則性のない数字に基づくプログラムにしたとしても，その統計的な性質，すなわち実現値の出現確率はある程度制御したいのである。` | `For example, when you "pull a gacha" in an app, a random number is generated internally, and based on that, determinations such as hits or misses are made. Similarly, in RPGs, there is a certain probability of failing an attack or landing a "critical hit". What's important here is that, even if the implementation in such games is based on numbers with no regularity, you would still want to control the statistical properties, that is, the probability of occurrence of actual values, to some extent.` |
| `[^6.3]: 厳密なエビデンスは示せないが，俗に「嘘のゴサンパチ」というように人間が適当に数字を述べると5,3,8が使われる率がチャンスレベルより高いと言われている。` | `Although rigorous evidence cannot be provided, it is commonly said that when people randomly state numbers, the usage rate of 5, 3, 8 is higher than chance level, as known by the idiom "Lie's Go San Pachi."` |
| `そこで，ある確率分布に基づく乱数を生成したい，ということになる。幸いにして，一様乱数(全ての実現値が等しい確率で生じる)を関数で変換することで，正規分布ほか様々な確率分布に従う乱数を作ることができる。Rにはその基本関数として幾つかの確率分布に従う乱数が実装されている。たとえば次のコードは，平均50，SD10の正規分布に従う乱数を10個出現させるものである。` | `So, suppose we want to generate random numbers based on a certain probability distribution. Fortunately, by transforming uniform random numbers (where all possible values occur with equal probability) with a function, we can create random numbers that follow various probability distributions, including the normal distribution. R has several basic functions implemented that generate random numbers according to various probability distributions. For example, the following code produces 10 random numbers that follow a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.` |

| `最も単純には，標本統計量が母数に近ければ近いほど，できれば一致してくれれば喜ばしい。先ほどの例では100人の村から10人しか取り出さなかったが，もし20人，30人とサンプルサイズが大きくなると母数に近づいていくことが予想できる。この性質のことを**一致性**consistencyといい，推定量が持っていてほしい性質のひとつである。幸い，標本平均は母平均に対して一致性を持っている。` | `Put simply, the closer the sample statistic is to the parameter, the better - ideally, they should match. In the previous example, we only drew 10 people from a village of 100, but if we increase the sample size to 20 or 30 people, we can expect to get closer to the parameter. This property is referred to as **consistency**, and it is one of the desirable characteristics of an estimator. Fortunately, the sample mean has consistency with respect to the population mean.` |
| `このことを確認してみよう。サンプルサイズを様々に変えて計算してみれば良い。例として，平均50,SD10の正規分布からサンプルサイズを2から1000まで増やしていくことにしよう。サンプルを取り出すことを，乱数生成に置き換えてその平均を計算していくこととする。` | `Let's check this out. We can calculate this by changing the sample size in various ways. For example, let's increase the sample size from 2 to 1000 from a normal distribution with an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Taking out a sample will be replaced with random number generation and we'll calculate its average.` |

The probability distribution followed by a sample statistic is called a **sample distribution**. If the probability density function of the sample distribution is known, its expected value and variance can also be calculated.

This is different from the sample variance and is called unbiased variance. The former has unbiasedness, while the latter does not. Let's try to confirm this using random numbers.` |

In contrast, the mean or expected value of unbiased variance using `var`, which is an embedded function of R, is `r mean(unbiased_vars)`, suggesting that this is preferable as an estimator for the population variance. It is known that a bias occurs in the sample variance, so the original formula was modified in advance to correct for this bias. Hopefully, this explanation will relieve anyone who was feeling frustrated.` |
| `他にも推定量の望ましい性質として有効性efficacyがあるが，詳細は @kosugi2023 を参照してほしい。この本には正規分布以外の例や，相関係数など他の標本統計量の例なども載っているが，いずれも乱数生成による近似で理解を進めるものである。諸君も数理統計的な説明に疲れたなら，ぜひ参考にしてもらいたい。` | `There is also efficacy as a desirable property of estimators, but for details, please refer to @kosugi2023. This book includes examples other than normal distribution and examples of other sample statistics such as correlation coefficients, all of which are to be understood through approximation by random number generation. If you are tired of mathematical statistical explanations, I would like you to refer to it by all means.` |

This is due to the probabilistic fluctuation that occurs when taking a sample. Although the sample mean has desirable properties such as consistency and unbiasedness, the sample mean is not equal to the population mean.` |
| `標本平均という確率変数の実現値一点でもって，母平均を推測することは，母平均を推測する上ではほぼ確実に外れるギャンブルである。そこで母数に対してある幅でもって推定することを考えよう。` | `Estimating the population mean with one realization value of a random variable called sample mean is almost certainly a miss in estimating the population mean. Therefore, consider estimating the parameters with a certain width.` |
| `たとえば平均50，標準偏差10の標準正規分布を母集団分布とし，サンプルサイズ10の標本をとり，その標本平均を母平均の推定値としよう(点推定)。同時に，その推定値に少し幅を持たせ，たとえば標本平均$\pm 5$の**区間推定**をしたとする。この時，真値$0$を正しく推測できる確率を，反復乱数生成のシミュレーションで確かめてみよう。` | `For example, consider a standard normal distribution with an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 as the population distribution, and take a sample of size 10 and use its sample mean as an estimate of the population mean (point estimation). At the same time, give the estimate some width, such as interval estimation of the sample mean $\pm 5$. At this time, let's confirm by simulation of repeated random number generation the probability of correctly guessing the true value of $0$.` |
