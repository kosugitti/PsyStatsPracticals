# Basics of R {#sec-Rbase}

We will now begin the exercise using R/RStudio. As previously mentioned, we will proceed on the assumption that a project has been prepared for this lecture and that RStudio is opened with the project.

## Calculate with R

First, let's start with calculations using R. Open the R script file and try entering the following four lines at the beginning.
Let's execute each line (Run button, or ctrl+enter) and check the results in the console.

You have not provided any Japanese text to be translated. Please provide it so that I can assist you better.
Sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text for translation. Could you please provide it?
I'm sorry but you didn't provide the Japanese text for me to translate it into English. Could you please provide it?
As an AI, I'm not able to directly access or process TeX code presented in the prompt. However, I can translate Japanese text into English. Please provide the Japanese text and I'll do my best to assist you!
Apologies, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text for the translation.
I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text so I could translate it for you.

Please confirm that the calculation results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are correct. The `[1]` in the output section is because R uses vectors as the basis for computation, which indicates that it returns the first element of the response vector.

In addition to the four arithmetic operations, the following operations are also possible.

Sure, but you haven't provided a Japanese text. Can you please provide the text that needs to be translated to English?
# Division of Integers
As an AI AI can't translate this as the text provided is not a Japanese text. It appears to be code or mathematical equation. Please provide the correct text.
I'm sorry, but no Japanese text appears. Could you please provide the text you'd like translated into English?
I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but there seems not to be any Japanese text provided to translate into English. Could you please provide the Japanese text?
# Exponentiation
Sure, to proceed with the translation, kindly provide me with the Japanese text that needs translation.
Sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the text you need translated?


Here, note that lines starting with `#` are **commented out** and will not be calculated even if they are actually sent to the console. There is no need to add comments when the script is simple, but when it becomes complicated or shared with others, it is convenient to explain "what operation is being performed now" one by one.

As a practical technique, there may be occasions where you comment out or uncomment multiple lines at once. After selecting multiple lines from the script, you can switch between commenting/uncommenting by pressing `Comment/Uncomment Lines` from the Code menu, so try it out. Also, check the shortcut key and get used to being able to comment/uncomment from the key (Ctrl+↑+C/Cmd+↑+C).

One more tip. There may be times when you want a large paragraph-like division (section division), not just a comment. There is "Insert Section" at the top of the Code menu, so try selecting this. You can also enter from the shortcut key (Ctrl+↑+R/Cmd+↑+R). If you give an appropriate name in the box to enter the section name, the section will be inserted into the script. The following is an example of a section.

As an AI, I don't see any actual Japanese text provided that I can translate to English. Please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated.
As an AI, I can't proceed further without the Japanese text, kindly provide the text to be translated.
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you need translated?

Of course, this won't affect the execution, but if the source becomes long, you can move in this section unit (at the lower left of the script pane), or you can check the outline (from the three horizontal lines at the top right of the script pane), so I'd like you to make use of it.

## Object

In R, everything such as variables and functions are treated as **objects**. Objects can be given any name (names starting with a number are not allowed).
Here is an example of creating an object and **assigning** a value to it.

There's no Japanese text provided for translation. Could you please provide text needed to be translated?
I'm sorry but there's no Japanese text provided for me to translate. Could you please provide the text?
You haven't provided any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want translated. The text "b <- 2" appears to be a line of code, not Japanese.
You forgot to provide the Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
As an AI, I can only translate text and don't have the capability to interpret or translate programming code. However, the Japanese portion of your text "におなじ" roughly translates to "equal to" in English.
"Same as in A + b # 3 + 2"
Apologies for the misunderstanding, but there is no provided Japanese text for me to translate into English. Could you please provide the text?

Here, numbers are stored in objects and calculations are made using these objects. Be careful as the calculation results may differ because upper and lower case letters are differentiated.

The symbol `<-` used for substitution is a "less than" and "hyphen", but it is an image of a left arrow. You can also use `=` or `->` as follows.

As an AI, I'm able to assist with translations but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated into English?
Sorry, but you forgot to provide the Japanese text. Please include it in your request.
Apologies for any confusion, but you haven't provided any Japanese text for me to translate into English. Please provide the text and I'd be happy to assist!
I'm sorry, I can't proceed until you provide the Japanese text that needs to be translated.

Here, `7 -> A` was done on the second line. I did `A <- 3` earlier, but since I reassigned 7 to `A` afterwards, the value is overwritten.

I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text to translate. Could you please add the text you want to be translated?
Sorry, the text provided is not Japanese. It seems to contain a mixture of regular alphabet characters and numbers. Please provide accurate Japanese text for translation.
In order to assist you accurately, I would need the specific Japanese text you want translated into English.

Please be aware that if you repeatedly assign values to an object in this way, it can be overwritten without any warnings. If you reuse similar object names, you could end up storing values or states that are different from what you originally intended.

By the way, to check the contents of an object, you just need to enter the object name as is. More politely, use the `print` function.

You didn't provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you want translated to English?
I'm sorry, I cannot translate this text as there is no Japanese text provided. Please provide the Japanese text you would like me to translate.
I'm sorry, but I can't translate this because it's not a Japanese text. It appears to be a code snippet or command.
I'm sorry, I can't translate your request because you didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

Alternatively, if you look at the Environment tab in RStudio, you can see the objects currently held by R, and in the case of a single value, you can see the object name and value in the Value section.

As a point of caution, the following names cannot be used as object names: break, else, for, if, in, next, function, repeat, return, while, TRUE, FALSE.

These are called **reserved words** with special meanings in R. In particular, `TRUE` and `FALSE` represent truth and falsehood, and can be substituted with the uppercase `T`, `F`. Therefore, it is better to avoid using just this one character as the object name.


Sure, but you need to provide the Japanese text you want to be translated into English.

In general, a function is represented as $y=f(x)$, but essentially, it refers to an operation where the shape of $y$ changes when $x$ is given.
In programming languages in general, $x$ is called an **argument** and $y$ is referred to as a **return value**. Below are some examples of function usage.

Sure, but you didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want me to translate.
I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide the text you need translated?
Apologies, but the input you provided doesn't seem to be Japanese text. Could you please provide the Japanese text that you want to translate into English?
You haven't provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you want to be translated into English.

The first example is the square root function `sqrt`, which returns the square root when given a number as an argument. The second example is the function description display function `help`. When you run this, the function description is displayed in the help pane.

## Types of Variables

The argument 'sqrt' given to the `help` function earlier is a string. It is enclosed in double quotes (`"`) to indicate that it is a string (it can also be enclosed in single quotes). In this way, R handles not only numbers but also other types of variables. There are three types of variables: numeric, character, and logical.

Apologies for the misunderstanding, but in order for me to proceed with translating the Japanese text into English, I'll need you to provide the text first.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the text you provided seems to be a line of code, not Japanese text. Please provide the correct text for translation.
You didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text that you want me to translate into English.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is not Japanese, it seems to be a line of code in R programming language. Could you please provide the Japanese text you'd like me to translate?
As a language model AI, I need the Japanese text to translate it into English. Please provide the Japanese text.

Numeric types include integers (integer) and real numbers (double) [^2.1], as well as complex types (complex), `NA` representing missing values, `NaN` (Not a Number) representing non-numerical values, and `Inf` representing infinity, among others.

Some might point out, 'Isn't a real number a real number?' Here, it refers to the double-precision floating-point number, a classification of numerical values on electronic computers. The term 'double-precision' indicates twice the precision, where the single precision uses 32 bits and the double precision uses 64 bits as the unit to represent a single number.

As already explained about the character type, please note that a pair of quotation marks is required. If there is no quotation to indicate the end, R will process the following numbers and characters as one "word". In that case, even if the enter key is pressed, the character input is not closed, and a "+" is displayed on the console (this symbol indicates that input is continuing from the previous line and it is not in a prompt state).

Of course, you cannot perform arithmetic operations on character types. However, the logical types 'TRUE/FALSE' correspond to 1 and 0 respectively, so the calculation results will be displayed. Let's run the following code to verify this.


I'm sorry, but without being provided the Japanese text, I cannot assist in translating it into English. Please provide the text you need to be translated.
Apologies for the misunderstanding, but you didn't provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you need translated into English?
Sorry, you haven't provided any Japanese text for translation. Please provide the text you would like to be translated.
Sure, I'd be glad to assist. However, it seems you've forgotten to include the Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide it?
I'm sorry, I can't proceed with the translation because there's no Japanese text provided. Can you please provide the text you want to translate?



## Type of Object

As we have seen so far, there are various types of numbers and characters (collectively called **literals**), and everything that stocks these is an **object**. Objects can be understood as variables, but functions are also included in objects.


I'm sorry, but there's no Japanese text in your request. Could you please provide the text you want to translate?

Objects in R are not things that only hold a single value. Rather, the characteristic is that they can hold multiple elements as a set. The following is an example of a **vector** object.

I'm really sorry, but you forgot to include the Japanese text you'd like me to translate into English. Could you please provide it?
Apologies, but I can't translate it as you've provided code, not Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text you'd like me to translate.
You forgot to input the Japanese text. All I see is code. Can you please input the Japanese text you want translated?
Sorry, your input doesn't seem to be in Japanese text. It appears to be a code snippet, not a sentence or phrase in Japanese that could be translated to English. Please provide a Japanese sentence or phrase for translation.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is not in Japanese. It appears to be a code snippet in R programming language. This line of code is creating a sequence vector "vec4" from 1 to 7 with a step of 2.
Please provide the Japanese text that needs to be translated into English. The provided text appears to be code, not Japanese.
Apologies for the confusion, but I can't translate the text as no Japanese text is provided. Could you please provide the text?

Let's check the contents of each object.
The initial `c()` is a combination function. Also, the colon (`:`) provides consecutive numbers.
The `seq` function takes multiple arguments, but it is a function that generates a continuous vector specifying the initial value, the end value, and the interval.

Calculation of vectors is performed for each element. Let's execute the following code and check how it behaves.

I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text for me to translate it into English. Please provide the text and I'd be happy to help!
I apologize for any confusion, but the provided text doesn't appear to contain any Japanese characters for translation. It seems to be a mathematical expression or programming code. Please provide the appropriate text for translation.
Sure, in order to assist you accurately, I need the Japanese text you want to translate.
It seems there's a mistake as you said "translate this Japanese text into English," but there's no Japanese text provided, only TeX code which refers to vector addition in mathematics. Please provide the Japanese text you want translated.
I'm sorry, but I can't proceed with the translation as you have not provided any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you want translated?

Let's focus on the fact that there were no errors in the final calculation. For example, `vec1 + vec4` would result in an error, but here we see a calculation result (= no error). Mathematically, calculations are not defined for vectors of different lengths, but the length of `vec1` was 3 and the length of `vec5` was 6. **R reuses the vector**, so when the long vector becomes a multiple of the short vector, it is used repeatedly. In other words, here.
Apologies for the confusion, but the provided input is a mathematical formula, not a Japanese text. The English translation retains the same as the formula is a universal language.
The calculation was performed. Be aware of this R specification to avoid unintended behavior.

When accessing elements of a vector, use square brackets (`[ ]`).
Let's make sure to check how to use the code in the second and third lines. In the brackets, you can either specify the element number or make a true/false judgment. This true/false selection method is useful because it allows you to specify elements using conditional clauses (if statements).
I'm sorry, there is no Japanese text provided. Could you please provide the text you want me to translate?
I'm sorry, but there is no Japanese text provided for me to translate. Can you please provide the Japanese text?
I'm sorry, but the provided text doesn't seem to be in Japanese. It appears to be a code snippet. Could you please provide the right text again?
I'm sorry, but the text you've provided doesn't appear to be Japanese. This looks like programming code. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated into English?
Sure, please provide the Japanese text you want translated into English.

Up until now, we have been explaining the elements of vectors in terms of numbers, but they can also be used as strings.

You'll need to provide the Japanese text you want translated into English.
I'm sorry, but the text you've provided is not Japanese. It's R programming code, which appears to be assigning a list of English words to the variable 'words1'. This list contains "Hello!", "Mr.", "Monkey", "Magic", "Orchestra". Could you please provide the Japanese text you'd like translated?
I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you need translated, and I'll be glad to assist.
I'm sorry, but there's not any Japanese text provided for me to translate. Could you please provide it?
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the text?
Apologies, but I can't assist with that because your text is currently missing. Could you please provide the Japanese text for translation?

Here, `LETTERS` is a reserved word vector containing 26 alphabets.

There are many functions that take vectors as arguments. For example, descriptive statistics such as average, variance, standard deviation, sum, etc., are calculated as follows.

You didn't provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated into English?
As an AI, I'm unable to translate coding language. However, If you did provide a Japanese text, I'd be more than happy to translate it for you. The coding language you provided seems to be an R programming command that creates a variable (dat) with the following values: 12, 18, 23, 35, 22.
mean(dat) # average
var(dat) # Variance
sd(dat) # Standard deviation
sum(dat) # Total
Sorry, I can't assist you with the task as you didn't provide any Japanese text.

Other functions such as maximum value `max`, minimum value `min`, and median `median` are also available.

You didn't provide me with a Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you want translated to English.

In mathematics, we deal with vectors in linear algebra, but at the same time, we probably also deal with two-dimensional matrices where vectors are aligned in rows.
You can use objects arranged like a matrix even in R.

Let's check what the matrices $A$ and $B$ created by the following code look like.
I'm sorry, but I can't help with that since you didn't provide any Japanese text for me to translate into English. Could you please provide the Japanese text?
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide me with any Japanese text to translate. The text you provided appears to be a snippet of code. Could you please provide the text in Japanese you wish to have translated into English?
You seem to have provided a line of code instead of Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text you'd like me to translate.
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide the Japanese text?

The function `matrix` creates a matrix and takes as arguments: the elements, the number of columns (`ncol`), the number of rows (`nrow`), and whether the element array is to be row-wise (`byrow`). Here, we have the elements as `1:6`, giving a continuous series of integers from 1 to 6. Since `ncol` explicitly states that there are two columns, there is no need to specify the number of rows with `nrow`. It should be obvious how the numbers change with or without `byrow` by displaying it.

If the number of given elements does not match the number of rows $\times$ columns and it's impossible to reuse the vector, an error will be returned.

Moreover, just like specifying elements of a vector, elements can also be specified in a matrix using brackets. They are specified in the order of rows and columns, and it is possible to specify only rows or only columns.

Sure, please provide the Japanese text you wish to have translated into English.
As you've mentioned this as TeX code, it seems you have provided an array or a matrix. But as this is not Japanese text, it's impossible to translate this into English. Please provide Japanese sentences or phrases.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is not Japanese, therefore making it impossible for me to translate. Could you please supply the correct text?
I'm sorry, but the text you've provided doesn't seem to be Japanese. Could you please provide the correct text for translation?
I'm sorry but I can't translate the text as I can't see any Japanese text that was provided in your message. Can you please provide the text that you want to translate?

You haven't provided any Japanese text for translation. Could you please provide the text you want to be translated?

Matrices are sets of vectors of equal size, but when you want to store elements of different sizes as a single object, you use a list type.

I'm sorry, you did not include any Japanese text in your request. Could you please provide it so that I can translate it?
I apologize for any misunderstanding, but the given text appears to be a code script, not Japanese. Could you please provide the correct Japanese text for translation?
I'm sorry but I can't assist you until you provide the Japanese text you want to be translated into English.

The first element (`[[1]]`) of this object is a vector, the second element is a matrix, and the third element is a single element vector (scalar). Let's think about how to access the elements of the elements (ex. the element at the 2nd row and 3rd column of the matrix of the second element) of the object.

This list requires numbers like `[[1]]` to access elements, but it becomes more convenient if you name the elements.

Apologies, but as a text-based AI, I can't process TeX codes or files. 
Please provide the Japanese text you want to translate.
You haven't provided any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
I'm sorry, but the text you're asking to translate appears to be a code snippet, not a Japanese sentence. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want translated?
You have not provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the Japanese text.
Sure, but there's no specific Japanese text provided. Please provide the text you want translated.
Sorry, I can't proceed with the translation as there is no Japanese text provided in the request. Please provide the text you want to translate and I'll be happy to assist!
Sorry, I can't see the Japanese text you want me to translate. Can you provide it, please?

When accessing the elements of this named list, you can use the `$` symbol.

I apologize, but I can't proceed with the translation as no Japanese text provided. Please include the Japanese text you would like translated into English.

Sorry, there's no Japanese text provided. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate?
As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to access your file with Japanese text. Please resend your Japanese text in plaintext, so I can help you translate it to English.

With this in mind, let's think about how to access the elements of the elements in a named list.

The list type is such that it does not matter the size or length of the elements, so you can store various things. The results of statistical functions are often obtained as lists, and in such cases, the elements of the list tend to be long. The `str` function can be used to see what kind of structure the list has.

I'm sorry, but I can't see the Japanese text you're wanting me to translate to English. Could you please paste or write it down?
I'm sorry, but I can't translate your request because you haven't provided any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to translate?
I'm sorry, but you have not provided any Japanese text for me to translate. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

The same result returned by the `str` function can also be obtained by viewing the object from the Environment tab in RStudio.
Also, a list can have another list as an element, meaning it can be hierarchical. In such cases, let's check how to access the required elements.

I'm sorry, you haven't provided any Japanese text to be translated. Can you please provide the text?
You forgot to provide the Japanese text. Please mention the text you want to translate.
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the text you need translated?
I'm sorry, but you seem to have forgotten to provide the Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide it?

"Data Frame Type"

I have already mentioned that the list type does not care about the size of the elements. However, when performing data analysis, it is often in the form of a two-dimensional spreadsheet. In other words, there is one observation per row, and each column represents a variable. This special type of list, which is rectangular and can have variable names in columns, is called the **data frame type**. Here is an example of such an object.

Sure, please provide the Japanese text that needs to be translated.
Sure, please provide the Japanese text that you need translated into English. The text supplied is not Japanese but rather a code snippet in R programming language.
You didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated into English.

By the way, I think you have learned about Stevens' levels of measurement, which is the basics of psychological statistics [@stevens1946]. There, the numbers are classified into four stages: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio measurement levels, based on the level of operations allowed for the values. Numbers at the interval and ratio measurement levels can be subjected to mathematical calculations, but numbers at the ordinal measurement level and nominal measurement level are not permitted such calculations (ex. Even if the second and third favorite persons come together, they cannot compete with the most favorite person).

R has numeric types that correspond to these scale levels. Interval/ratio scale levels can be calculated, so a 'numeric' type is fine, but nominal scale levels are a 'factor' type (also known as causative or factor type), and ordinal scale levels are a type called 'ordered.factor'.

Here's an example of a variable of factor type. The `as.factor` function can be used to convert an existing character type into a factor type.

Sure, but you didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated.
There seems to be some confusion here. The text you provided is actually computer programming code (R language), not Japanese. The English translation of the provided code essentially would be:

"Convert the 'origin' column of the data frame 'df' into a factor."
I'm sorry, but the text you've provided is not in Japanese. It seems to be a line of code. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate?
As a AI, I will need the Japanese text to translate it into English. Please provide it.

As can be clearly seen when displaying the elements, there are three values: 'Shizuoka', 'Shizuoka', 'Hokkaido', but there are two levels: 'Shizuoka' and 'Hokkaido'. In this way, it is convenient to use as a category by making it a factor type.

The following is an example of an ordered factor type variable.
Sorry, there seems to be an error as no Japanese text has been provided. Please include the text you'd like translated.
# Example of Ordered Factor Type
Sure, here is the English translation of the text: 

ratings <- factor(c("Low", "High", "Moderate", "High", "Low"),
Sorry, it seems you haven't provided any Japanese text. The text you've given appears to be code rather than Japanese language. Please provide the Japanese text you need translated.
I'm sorry, but what you've provided seems to be a code or a code setting, not a Japanese text. Could you please provide the correct text you'd like to be translated?
Your Japanese text wasn't provided. Please provide it so that I can assist you.
# Check the content and type of ratings
As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to process and translate Japanese text unless it's provided. Please provide the Japanese text you're referring to.
I'm sorry, but there is no Japanese text included in your message. Please provide the text you'd like translated.

There may be few examples of use, as it does not differ from the factor type when tallying, etc. However, when applying statistical models in R, there are behaviors corresponding to the scale level, so it would be good to carefully set the scale level of the data.

Access to elements in the DataFrame will basically be through variable names. For example, if you want to perform statistical processing on a numeric variable of the object `df` we mentioned earlier, it would be good to do as follows.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that because you didn't specify any Japanese text to translate into English. Please provide the Japanese text.
You haven't provided any Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide the text that needs to be translated?
Sorry but your request does not include Japanese text. The input you gave was a line of code, not Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text you would like translated.
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you need translated.

Also, there is a function to summarize the data frame object all at once.

Apologies, but your request doesn't include any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text so I can assist you further.
I'm sorry but there's no Japanese text provided to translate. Please provide the Japanese text you need translated.
Apologies for the inconvenience, but the text you want translated from Japanese to English appears to be missing. Would you be able to provide it so that I can assist you?

## Loading External Files

In actual analysis, it is common to retrieve the data set from a database or read it from another file, rather than inputting it manually.

Many statistical packages have their own file formats, and R has prepared reading functions for each of them, but here we show an example of reading from the most plain form of data, the CSV format.

Consider loading the provided sample data, `Baseball.csv`. Note that this data is saved in UTF-8 format[^2.2]. The function `read.csv`, which R has by default, can be used to load it.

You'll need to provide the Japanese text you want translated into English.
Sorry, you have provided a line of code, not Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text you want to translate.
I'm sorry but there's no Japanese text to translate. Could you provide me with the text you want translated?
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is not Japanese. It appears to be code or a command of some sort. Please provide Japanese text for translation.
Sure, please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated.

Here, the `head` function is used to display the beginning part of objects such as data frames (default is 6 lines). Also, as obvious from the result of `str` function, the loaded file is automatically converted to a data frame type.

By the way, the character `NA` was entered in the places corresponding to missing values ​​in the sample data. The `read.csv` function treats missing values ​​as the string "NA" by default. However, in reality, they may be other characters (e.g., period) or specific values ​​(e.g., 9999). In such cases, you should instruct the 'value to be treated as a missing value' with the `na.strings` option.

Sorry, but there is no Japanese text to translate.

Now, having written the script up to this point, I believe you have created a fairly lengthy script file.
Regarding the description of the script, of course, there is an approach that says "it's good enough if it works", but it would be even better if it can be written beautifully. There may be different opinions on how to define "beautiful", but generally there is a method of fair copy known as "code conventions". We won't go into detail here, but try executing Reformat Code from the RStudio's Code menu. Doesn't the script file look neatly organized?

Beautiful code is also useful for debugging. Keep in mind to reformat occasionally.

## Task

Launch R and create a new script file. In that file, declare two integers, perform addition, and display the result in the console.

Please write the following calculations in the script and run it.
Sorry, I am an AI model designed to translate texts, your TeX code contains mathematical fractions which don't need translating. But if you have any text in Japanese that needs translating, feel free to ask.
Sure, but you've provided a mathematical expression, not Japanese text. The translation of your expression to English would be: "Nine point six divided by four."
I'm sorry, but the text you've provided seems to be in a mathematical format, not Japanese. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want translated?
You didn't provide any Japanese text. However, I can translate the mathematical expression you provided. It translates to: "Three times the sum of two point two and four fifths." Please provide the Japanese text you want translated.
As a translator, I can tell you that you've provided a mathematical expression, not a Japanese text. The expression "$(-2)^4$" means "negative two raised to the power of four" in English.
As an AI developed by OpenAI, my primary function is to work with text, but I cannot interact directly with TeX code (often used for typesetting mathematical and scientific documents). However, I'm here to assist you with language translations. Please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate.
Without the Japanese text, I'm unable to provide the correct translation. Could you please provide the needed text?

Please create a vector within the R script file. The vector should store integers from 1 to 10. After that, please calculate the sum and average of the vector elements. The function to sum the vector is `sum`, and the average is `mean`.

Please convert the following table into a list type object `Tbl`.


To provide a translation, I require the Japanese text that you want to be translated into English.

I'm sorry, there seems to be any Japanese text provided. Could you please provide the Japanese text that you want to have translated?
You need to provide the Japanese text that you want to translate into English.
Sorry, there is no Japanese text provided to translate. Can you please provide the text?
Apologies for the confusion, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to translate. If you provide a Japanese text, I would be more than happy to help with the translation.

Please display the value of Tokyo's Area from the 'Tbl' object created earlier (access to list elements).

Please calculate the average of the population (Pop) variable in the `Tbl` object.

Please convert the `Tbl` object to the dataframe-type object `df2`. You may create a new one or use the `as.data.frame` function.

Please use the R script to load the `Baseball2022.csv` file and store it in the `dat` dataframe. Please note that the missing values in this file are denoted as $999$.

Please display the first 10 lines of the 'dat' you have loaded.

Please apply the `summary` function to the loaded `dat`.

The variable `team` in this dataset is at a nominal scale level. Please change it to Factor type. There are also two other variables that should be converted to Factor type, so please convert them in the same way.

Among the variables of this dataset, calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, and median for numerical data.
Please calculate each one.

Please format the script file where you wrote the task, by using Reformat or other similar tools.

UTF-8 is a type of character code that translates machine data consisting of zeros and ones into human language. It is the most common character code worldwide. However, since the Windows OS still uses a local character code called Shift-JIS by default, opening this file in Excel on a Windows machine often results in gibberish characters, making the following procedures often not function correctly. If you are using this in this lecture, we recommend loading the file directly into R without opening it in Excel after downloading.
