# Probability and Simulation

## Understanding and Applications of Probability

Statistics and probability have a close relationship.
One point is that when you gather a lot of data, you can see overall trends that are not visible in individual cases, and you use the concept of probability to express that.
Even when there is not much data, when a part is taken out from a large whole and considered a sample, we think about how the sample reflects the properties of the whole. Here, when expressing the chance of taking a part from the overall trend, we will use the concept of probability.
Finally, even with machines whose behavior is understood theoretically and fundamentally, practical and actual systematic deviations may occur, and random errors that can only be considered as accidental may creep in. The former can be handled by adjusting the machine, but the latter requires consideration of the probability that chance follows.

Psychology conducts research on humans, but because one cannot investigate all humans at once, one extracts samples and conducts surveys or experiments (the second case). In data science, the data set can contain tens of thousands of records, but in psychology, it is often only a few to several dozen. Furthermore, even if we could theoretically model psychological tendencies, there is a high possibility that actual behavior contains errors (the third case). From these circumstances, the data obtained in psychology can be considered a random variable, and it is used with **inferential statistics**, which infers the properties of the population from small samples.

In a strict mathematical sense, **probability** is defined by a buildup of intricate concepts such as sets, integrals, and measures[^6.1]. Here, rather than getting into the details, it would be sufficient to understand it simply as "something that expresses the magnitude of the possibility of a specific result occurring, with a real number between 0 and 1". From this definition, it could be interpreted as the "ratio of the occurrence of the event among all possible combinations", as well as the "degree of belief about the strength of truthfulness weighed subjectively"[^6.2].
You may have thought that the probability you've learned so far is boring, as it involves writing out all the permutations and combinations, but numbers like "it's almost certainly wrong (thinking that it's about 80-90% sure)" can also be treated as a type of probability, making it a very familiar concept with a wide range of applications. One point to advance your understanding is that you may want to consider probability in terms of area. The concept is to think of probability as a measurement that expresses to what extent the occurrence of an event occupies a proportion of the total space of all possible situations (@Hiraoka200910 consistently explains this in his book. This explanation makes it easier to understand conditional probabilities and so on).

For more details, please refer to @Yoshida2021-02-25, @Kono1999-05-01, @Sato1994-02-25, etc.

The former interpretation is the probability learned in mathematics up to high school, and it is sometimes called frequency probability. On the other hand, the latter interpretation is often used in everyday life, such as a precipitation probability of X%, and it can be referred to as subjective probability. While some may argue that these differences in interpretation are not mathematical but differences in belief, in reality, Kolmogorov's axioms have been arranged to apply to both views. Personally, the author believes that either is fine as long as it is easy for users to understand and calculate.

However, what I would like you to carefully distinguish is the difference between a random variable and its realized value. The values contained in a dataset or spreadsheet are ultimately the realized values of a random variable, and a random variable is a term that refers to the variable itself in its uncertain state. A die is a random variable, but the outcome of a dice roll is the realized value of a random variable. A psychological variable is a random variable, but the data obtained is its realized value. The process involves understanding the characteristics of the variable through its realized values and making inferences about the whole.

You may feel it is difficult to proceed with discussions on abstract entities beyond the data in front of you. In fact, this is true for everyone, and understanding probability accurately is very difficult. However, through functions implemented in computer languages such as R, let's gradually understand by operating more concretely.

## Probability Distribution Function

The realized values of a random variable follow a **probability distribution**. A probability distribution is a comprehensive overview that represents how likely each value is to occur, and it is generally expressed as a function. The name varies depending on whether the values are continuous or discrete, but the continuous probability distribution function is called **probability density function**, while the discrete probability distribution function is called **probability mass function**.

Several functions related to probability are prepared in R from the beginning. For the most famous probability distribution, the **normal distribution**, there are functions like the following.

The function used here is `dnorm`, where `d` stands for Density (probability density), and `norm` is a part of Normal Distribution. In this way, in R, function is made up of a name representing a probability distribution (here it is `norm`) and a prefix single letter (`d`). This prefix letter includes `p`,`q`, and `r`. They are used like `dpois` (probability density function of Poisson distribution), `pnorm` (cumulative distribution function of normal distribution), `rbinom` (random number generation from binomial distribution).

Let's continue explaining using the normal distribution as an example. A normal distribution is characterized by its mean ʻμ` and standard deviation `σ`. These numerical characteristics of a probability distribution are called "parameters". For instance, the following three curves represent normal distributions with different parameters.

The average is called the location parameter, and the standard deviation is called the scale parameter, which can alter the distribution's location and width. In other words, we can set the parameters of the normal distribution to fit the data as much as possible. If it has the characteristics of being symmetric and unimodal, then a wide range of patterns can be represented by the normal distribution.

Now, all the functions used in the above example had 'd' at the beginning, such as 'dnorm', which represents the height of the probability distribution density. But what do 'p' and 'q' represent? I will give numerical and graphic examples, so I want you to check their correspondence.

If the numbers are not intuitively understandable, let's check the following figure. The `pnorm` function returns the probability (i.e., the area up to there, the colored area drawn in the code below) when given an x-coordinate value. The `qnorm` function returns the x-coordinate value when the integral value of the area under the probability density function curve equals the given probability (which equals the area).

Explaining what a random number is as difficult as explaining what it means to be random (a random variable).
To put it simply, it means a sequence of numbers without regularity.
However, since computers calculate numbers correctly according to algorithms, strictly speaking, they cannot generate random numbers without any rules.
The numbers generated by a computer's random number generator are actually produced according to a random number generating algorithm. Although they appear random, they actually have a pattern, so it is more accurate to call them pseudorandom numbers.

However, it is much more effective to generate a sequence of numbers with no particular pattern than for a human to recite arbitrary numbers off the top of their head[^6.3], and while it may only be pseudo, it is still very useful.
For example, when you "pull a gacha" in an app, a random number is generated internally, and based on that, determinations such as hits or misses are made. Similarly, in RPGs, there is a certain probability of failing an attack or landing a "critical hit". What's important here is that, even if the implementation in such games is based on numbers with no regularity, you would still want to control the statistical properties, that is, the probability of occurrence of actual values, to some extent.

Although rigorous evidence cannot be provided, it is commonly said that when people randomly state numbers, the usage rate of 5, 3, 8 is higher than chance level, as known by the idiom "Lie's Go San Pachi."

So, suppose we want to generate random numbers based on a certain probability distribution. Fortunately, by transforming uniform random numbers (where all possible values occur with equal probability) with a function, we can create random numbers that follow various probability distributions, including the normal distribution. R has several basic functions implemented that generate random numbers according to various probability distributions. For example, the following code produces 10 random numbers that follow a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.

As an AI, I can inform you that the text you've provided isn't Japanese, but rather a line of code in R, a popular language for statistical computing and graphics. Here's what the code does in English:

"Generate 10 numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10."
Apologies for the misunderstanding, but you haven't provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you want to be translated.

For example, if you want to create practice problems for psychological statistics and need an appropriate array of numbers, you might want to do it this way. However, if you try to create the same problem again, different numbers will come out because it's random.

Sure, but you didn't provide any Japanese text to be translated. Could you please provide the Japanese text?
I'm sorry, but the provided text seems to be R statistical computing language, not Japanese. It's a command to generate a normal distribution of 10 numbers with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10.
I'm sorry, but I cannot translate the text as you didn't provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to translate.

It may be desirable to produce reproducible random numbers since they're nothing more than pseudorandom numbers. In such cases, use the `set.seed` function. Pseudorandom numbers are calculated from the internal random number seed, so by fixing this number, the same random numbers can be reproduced.

In order to translate your text from Japanese to English, I need you to provide the text first.
# Specify the seed
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided appears to be a code command in a programming language called R, not a Japanese sentence. The command "set.seed(12345)" sets the starting point for generating random numbers in statistical simulations and other randomized procedures in R. Could you provide me a Japanese text to translate into English?
As an AI, I can only translate textual phrases or sentences. The given code "rnorm(n = 3)" is a function in R programming language that generates 3 random numbers from a normal distribution. It's not a Japanese text and thus, cannot be translated into English.

One use of random numbers, as mentioned earlier, would be when you want to set up a program to behave as if it's acting by chance.

In fact, there are other uses for it. It's used when we specifically want to know the probability distribution. What I'm going to show next is a histogram when $n = 10,100,1000,10000$ from the standard normal distribution.

I'm sorry, but you forgot to provide the Japanese text to be translated.

When you look at this, the first 10 or so histograms appear to have an irregular distribution, but as you increase it to 100 and 1000, you can see that it gradually approximates to the theoretical shape of the normal distribution.

In R, in addition to the Poisson distribution and binomial distribution, probability distribution functions such as the familiar t-distribution, F-distribution, and χ^2 distribution are also implemented. It may be difficult to visualize these distributions just by hearing the values of the parameters, but when such times arise, you can generate a large amount of random numbers with specified parameters and draw a histogram, making it easier to understand the shape of the probability distribution function.

In fact, one of the reasons for the recent prosperity of Bayesian statistics is largely due to the contributions of computer science. **Markov chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) is a random number generation technique that can generate random numbers even from post-distributions created by models without clear names. Although it is difficult to demonstrate this distribution analytically, random numbers can be generated from it, and by looking at the histogram, its shape can be visualized.

Moreover, the advantages of this random number usage are not limited to visualization. Consider a scenario where you want to know the area (=probability) within a certain range in the standard normal distribution. For instance, let's say we want to find the area from the probability point -1.5 to +1.5. Given we understand the formula for the normal distribution, it's possible to calculate this area as follows.
Sorry, but the text you've provided isn't in Japanese. It's a mathematical formula written in LaTeX code which represents a definite integral. The formula computes the integral from -1.5 to 1.5 of the normal (Gaussian) probability density function.

Of course, we know the `pnorm` function, so we can get a numerical solution as follows.

I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Please provide the text you want translated.
I'm sorry, the provided text is a piece of R code, not Japanese language. It's a code for calculation of the probability density function between -1.5 and 1.5 in a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It has nothing to do with Japanese and doesn't require a translation.
Sure, I can help with that. However, you forgot to provide the Japanese text that you want to be translated. Please provide it so I can assist you.

The same can be done with random numbers, and an approximate solution can be obtained as follows.

You didn't provide any text but I'm ready to translate from Japanese to English as soon as you provide the text.

Here, 10,000 random numbers are generated and a factor-type variable `FLG` is created to indicate whether they fall within a specified range (1 if they do, 2 if they don't). The numbers are grouped and counted according to this variable, divided by the total number to obtain the relative frequency. Probability is the proportion of the relative area occupied in the whole, and in this case, the value for the relevant area is approximately equal to the solution calculated by the `pnorm` function, at `0.866`.


Moreover, it is easy to visualize the range if done as follows.
I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the Japanese text that you need translated into English?

As an AI model, I'm sorry but I can not directly translate this because it is a line of code in R programming language intended to create a histogram with a specified bin width, not a Japanese text. In English, the meaning is "create a histogram with binwidth equals to 0.01".
As a language model AI, I need the actual Japanese text to provide you with the correct translation.

To repeat, even if it is difficult to imagine the shape of the probability distribution or analytically write down its formula, it can be visualized by turning it into specific numbers and creating a histogram, and approximate probability calculations can also be made.

The accuracy can't be trusted because it's just an approximation, so if one is sceptical, they can increase the number of random numbers generated by 10 times or 100 times. In the current computational capabilities of today's computers, such an increase is not a significant burden. The fact that complex integral calculation becomes an issue of descriptive statistics (counting) is a big advantage in that it can be understood concretely.

I would like you to consider this further, psychologists obtain data through psychological experiments and surveys. However, considering individual differences and errors, these are considered to be random variables. Even with just a few to several tens of data in front of you, statistical processing is performed assuming a normal distribution. The essence is the same even when applied to data generated by random numbers. In other words, it is possible to simulate with random numbers before conducting the survey experiment. Before taking a one-shot real deal in survey experiments, it is important to concretely confirm in advance what properties the data you are trying to obtain may have.

## Practice Problems; Using Random Numbers

Let's use standard random numbers to approximate the following value. Also, try to devise a way to achieve an accuracy up to two decimal places compared to the "true value" set or calculated analytically.

1. Expected value of a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 8. The expected value of a continuous random variable is expressed by the following formula. $$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx$$ Here, $x$ represents the random variable and $f(x)$ is the probability density function, which is obtained by integrating the entire domain of the probability density function. The expected value of a normal distribution matches the mean parameter, so the true value in this case will be the set $100$.

"Let's calculate the variance of the normal distribution with an average of 100 and a standard deviation of 3. The variance of a continuous random variable is represented by the following formula:

 $$\sigma^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 f(x) \, dx$$

Here, $\mu$ is the expected value of the random variable. The variance of a normal distribution matches the square of the standard deviation parameter, so in this case, the true value is $3^2 = 9$."
3. The area of the probabilistic variable $X$ which follows a normal distribution with an average of 65 and a standard deviation of 10, between $90 < X < 110$. The results calculated analytically are as follows.

I'm sorry, but your message appears to be incomplete. There's no Japanese text provided for me to translate. Could you please provide the text?
Your provided text seems like a code segment used in statistical analysis, more specifically in R programming for normal distribution, not a Japanese text. In terms of explaining this code, it computes the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean 65 and standard deviation 10 is between 92 and 108.
As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I could definitely help you but you need to provide the Japanese text you want to be translated.
4. The probability that the realized value in a normal distribution with an average of 10 and a standard deviation of 10 will be 7 or more. The results of the analytical calculation are as follows.

You did not provide a Japanese text. Please give me the Japanese text you want to be translated into English.
It seems like you've posted some code, not Japanese text. The code you've posted is related to statistics, more precisely it's a command in R programming environment used to calculate the lower tail of the normal probability distribution function. It's actually not in Japanese and doesn't require translation. If you provide an actual Japanese text, I would be pleased to assist you with that.
As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I need to know the specific Japanese text that you want me to translate into English. Could you please provide it for me?

5. Suppose we have the random variables X and Y. X follows a normal distribution with mean 10, SD 10 while Y follows a normal distribution with mean 5, SD 8. Assuming that X and Y are independent, please verify using random numbers that the mean and variance of the sum Z = X + Y, matches the sum of the means and variances of X and Y respectively.

## Population and Sample

So far, we have seen how to use random numbers to examine the properties of probability distributions. From here, we will consider the use of probability distributions in inferential statistics. In inferential statistics, the entire population we want to know about is referred to as the **population**, and the partial data obtained from it is referred to as the **sample**. Inferential statistics/statistical inference is about using the statistical properties of a sample to infer the properties of the population. The statistical parameter that represents the characteristics of the population is called the **parameter**, and the terms such as population mean, population variance etc., are labelled with the word "population" to indicate they are information about the population. Similarly, we can calculate the mean and variance of the sample, but in this case, we may label them as sample mean, sample variance etc., to explicitly emphasize the difference.


Let's look at a specific example using random numbers. Suppose there was a village consisting of 100 people. Let's assume we measured the height of the people in this village and turned it into data. Thinking of 100 appropriate numbers is troublesome, so we will generate random numbers instead.

I'm sorry, but I need the Japanese text to translate into English. Can you provide it, please?

This time, the population mean is `r M`, and the sample mean is `r m1`. Since we can only know the sample values, when we get the sample mean `r m1`, it's not strange to infer that the population mean will also be around `r m1`. However, the sample mean can change with each sampling method. Let's say we took another sample as a test.

# Sample Average Part 2

The sample mean this time turned out to be `r m2`. Once this data is obtained, you will undoubtedly guess that the population mean would be "a value close to `r m2`". Comparing `r m1` of sample 1 and `r m2` of sample 2, the former is closer to the correct answer `r M` (the difference is `r M-m1` and `r M-m2`, respectively). In other words, depending on how the sample is collected, there can be hits and misses. Even when collecting data and conducting research, whether the results support the hypothesis or not lies beneath such probabilistic fluctuations.

In other words, **a sample is a random variable, and sample statistics can also stochastically vary**. When estimating parameters with sample statistics, it is necessary to know the properties of the sample statistics and the probability distribution they follow. Let's look at the desirable properties of estimators that have desirable properties for estimating parameters.

You didn't provide any text to translate. Could you please provide the Japanese text you'd like translated into English?

Put simply, the closer the sample statistic is to the parameter, the better - ideally, they should match. In the previous example, we only drew 10 people from a village of 100, but if we increase the sample size to 20 or 30 people, we can expect to get closer to the parameter. This property is referred to as **consistency**, and it is one of the desirable characteristics of an estimator. Fortunately, the sample mean has consistency with respect to the population mean.

Let's check this out. We can calculate this by changing the sample size in various ways. For example, let's increase the sample size from 2 to 1000 from a normal distribution with an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Taking out a sample will be replaced with random number generation and we'll calculate its average.

As the sample size increases, it can be seen that it approaches the true value of 50. Try changing the shape of the population distribution, parameters, sample size, etc. to confirm this.

You didn't provide the Japanese text you wanted translated. Could you please input that?

The estimator is a random variable, and its properties can be described by a probability distribution. The probability distribution followed by a sample statistic is called a **sample distribution**. If the probability density function of the sample distribution is known, its expected value and variance can also be calculated. One of the desirable properties of an estimator is that its expected value (mean) matches the population parameter, which is referred to as **unbiasedness**.

One of the steps that frustrates beginners when studying psychological statistics is the operation of dividing by $n-1$ instead of the sample size $n$ when calculating variance. This is different from the sample variance and is called unbiased variance. The former has unbiasedness, while the latter does not. Let's try to confirm this using random numbers.

From a population with an average of 50, SD10 (population variance $10^2=100$), repeatedly obtain a sample of size $n=20$. This is done by generating random numbers of size 20. For each sample, calculate the sample variance and unbiased variance, and then calculate their average (expected value of the sample statistic).

The mean or expected value of the object `vars` that calculated the sample variance is `r mean(vars)`, which is somewhat away from the set value (true value) of 100. In contrast, the mean or expected value of unbiased variance using `var`, which is an embedded function of R, is `r mean(unbiased_vars)`, suggesting that this is preferable as an estimator for the population variance. It is known that a bias occurs in the sample variance, so the original formula was modified in advance to correct for this bias. Hopefully, this explanation will relieve anyone who was feeling frustrated.

There is also efficacy as a desirable property of estimators, but for details, please refer to @kosugi2023. This book includes examples other than normal distribution and examples of other sample statistics such as correlation coefficients, all of which are to be understood through approximation by random number generation. If you are tired of mathematical statistical explanations, I would like you to refer to it by all means.

## Confidence Interval

The sample statistic is a random variable and changes each time a sample is taken. This is due to the probabilistic fluctuation that occurs when taking a sample. Although the sample mean has desirable properties such as consistency and unbiasedness, the sample mean is not equal to the population mean.

Estimating the population mean with one realization value of a random variable called sample mean is almost certainly a miss in estimating the population mean. Therefore, consider estimating the parameters with a certain width.

For example, consider a standard normal distribution with an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 as the population distribution, and take a sample of size 10 and use its sample mean as an estimate of the population mean (point estimation). At the same time, give the estimate some width, such as interval estimation of the sample mean $\pm 5$. At this time, let's confirm by simulation of repeated random number generation the probability of correctly guessing the true value of $0$.

As can be seen from the results, the point estimate never correctly hits the parameter. This is natural, because when done with real numbers, there can be a gap at some point after the decimal point, and if accuracy is ignored, it is impossible to match. In contrast, in the case of predictions with widths, the true value is included in the interval for `r result.df$n2` times out of `r iter` trials, and its accuracy rate is `r result.df$prob2 * 100`%.


To achieve 100% accuracy in interval estimation, the interval must be infinitely wide (in the case of estimating the population mean). Since this is practically equivalent to not estimating at all, it is customary to allow about 5% failure and aim for interval estimation with a 95% accuracy. This interval is known as the 95% **confidence interval**.


Confidence Interval in the Case Where the Population Variance of the Normal Distribution is Known

We may apply the above simulation to adjust the interval until the probability that interval estimation is justified becomes 95%, but indeed that is troublesome, so let me introduce a property that has become clear in inferential statistics.

If it is known that the population follows a normal distribution, with a population mean of $\mu$ and a population variance of $\sigma^2$, it is understood that the distribution of sample means follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu$, variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ (standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$).

The 95% interval of the standard normal distribution is approximately $\pm 1.96$.

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with the translation. But you would need to provide the Japanese text first.
When you remove 2.5% from both ends
I apologize for any confusion, but "qnorm(0.025)" is a function in R programming used in statistics, not Japanese text. It represents the 0.025 quantile of a standard normal distribution. It is also often used to calculate confidence intervals or cutoffs for hypothesis testing in statistics. Could you kindly provide the Japanese text that you would like me to translate into English?
As a translator, I would need Japanese text to translate into English. However, the provided "qnorm(0.975)" is a statistical function in R programming language, which calculates the 97.5 percentile in a standard normal distribution (Z-distribution). Could you please provide Japanese text for translation?
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that because you didn't provide Japanese text to be translated. Please provide the text so I can help.

When combined, when the sample average is $\bar{X}$, the 95% confidence interval becomes the following by multiplying the standard deviation by 1.96.

I'm sorry, but the provided text is not in Japanese. Instead, it appears to be a mathematical formula in LaTeX, a typesetting system used for scientific documents.

The formula itself is for the calculation of a confidence interval for a population mean "mu" (μ). It can be translated as:
"The population mean is equal to or greater than the sample mean minus 1.96 times the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, and equal or less than the sample mean plus 1.96 times the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size." This is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean when the population standard deviation is known.


Let's apply the numerical example we just discussed to confirm this. It turns out that the true value is included within the interval at a rate close to 95%.

I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you want translated?
I'm sorry, but the provided text is not in Japanese. It appears to be a line of programming code, specifically in R, a language for statistical computing. This code is for calculating a confidence interval.

Confidence Interval when Population Variance of Normal Distribution is Unknown

In the previous example, we discussed the case when the population variance is known, but if the population mean and population variance are known, there's no need to estimate them, so in practice, it becomes necessary to estimate in cases where the population variance is unknown. Fortunately, in such cases, in other words, when the population variance is replaced with unbiased variance (sample statistic), it is known that the sample mean follows a t-distribution with a degree of freedom of $n-1$. (For details, refer to @kosugi2023)
But in that case, since the shape of the t-distribution changes depending on the sample size, the confidence interval is calculated using the following formula, not limited to the 95% interval being $\pm 1.96$ like the standard normal distribution.
As an AI, I can explain that this appears to be a mathematical formula rather than a written Japanese text. The formula seems to depict the Confidence Interval for a sample mean in statistics, utilizing the t-distribution. However, if you meant to include specific Japanese text for translation, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

Here, $T_{0.025}$ refers to the 2.5th percentile of the t-distribution, and $T_{0.975}$ refers to the 97.5th percentile. Since the t-distribution is symmetric (if the mean is 0), you can also think of $T_{0.025} = -T_{0.975}$. Also, $U^2$ is the unbiased variance ($U$ is its square root).

Let's also check this with an approximate calculation using random numbers. We can see that the true value is included in the interval at a rate close to 95%.
