<p>You seem to have forgotten to attach the Japanese text. Please provide it so I could help translate it for you. Apologies for the confusion, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you would like translated. I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate into English. Could you please provide the text you’d like me to translate? I’m sorry, but the text you provided isn’t in Japanese. It’s a line of code in the R programming language. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want translated? I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you want translated? ## How to Use Rmd/Quarto</p>
<p>Sorry, but you haven’t provided any text to translate. Could you please provide the Japanese text?</p>
<p>This time, I’m going to explain how to create documents using RStudio. I assume that so far, when it comes to creation, you have been basically using document creation software like Microsoft Word. Also, for statistical analysis, you would typically use different applications depending on the purpose, like R (and other software), and Excel for creating charts and graphs.</p>
<p>This method often requires a lot of transcription work, such as copying and pasting numerical results of statistical analyses into spreadsheet software, and then copying and pasting charts created there into document creation software. If there are transcription errors or pasting mistakes here, it goes without saying that the resulting document will be incorrect. Such transcription errors are sometimes referred to as “copy-and-paste contamination”.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the task of bridging this environment; if calculations, diagrams, and documents can be completed in one environment, such problems will not occur. R markdown and Quarto are formats/software that solve this problem.</p>
<p>Rmarkdown’s <code>markdown</code> is a type of formatting. It’s a kind of notation called markup language, and what’s specialized for collaboration with R is Rmarkdown. Markup language refers to a method of embedding specialized symbols in language, and using a reading application that corresponds to that format, to format the display. Famous markup languages include LaTeX, which is specialized for mathematical formulas, and HTML, which is used on internet websites.</p>
<p>Rmarkdown follows the format of markdown and has commands to embed the results of R execution in the text. It specifies in a markup language where to embed the results while calculating and creating graphs and tables with R commands. When eventually viewing the document, it is necessary to convert (compile, or knit) the markup language to the output file, at which time the R calculations are executed. Since it is calculated every time it is compiled, even the same code can produce different results if it uses random numbers or changes some input files. However, unlike paste pollution, it does not contain incorrect values or graphic tables, so it contributes to the reproducibility of research. For more information on creating reproducible documents, refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="Takahashi201805">高橋 (<a href="#ref-Takahashi201805" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Quarto is an extension of Rmarkdown, and it is one of the softwares that Posit, the provider of RStudio, is now focusing on the most. While Rmarkdown was a collaboration between R and markdown, Quarto supports not only R, but also other languages such as Python and Julia, and allows for the coexistence of multiple computing languages. This means, for example, we can calculate a section with R, verify the results with Python, and plot it with Julia, all in a single file.</p>
<p>This class material is also created with Quarto. Quarto can be used to create presentation materials and websites, and it is possible to output not only websites but also PDFs and ePUBs (a format for e-books). In addition, the materials for this class are output in both <a href="Psychology statistics practice.PDF">PDF format</a> and <a href="Psychology statistics practice.epub">ePUB format</a> at the same time. There is no specialized commentary book about Quarto yet, but there is a wealth of documents on the Internet, so it would be good to search for them. Since it is still a new technology, it is best to refer to the <a href="https://quarto.org/">official</a> as a first reference.</p>
<p>Creating a File and Knitting</p>
<p>Rmarkdown works well with RStudio, and you can create a new Rmarkdown file with a sample by selecting <code>R Markdown</code> from RStudio’s File &gt; New File. A sub-window will open at creation allowing you to specify the document title, author name, creation date and time, and output format. Once created, an R markdown file containing sample code will appear.</p>
<p>Similarly with Quarto, you can open a new file screen by selecting ‘Quarto Document’ from File &gt; New File in RStudio. It is common to use the extension ‘Rmd’ for R markdown files, and ‘Qmd’ for Quarto. Moreover, Quarto is designed to be used from editors other than RStudio, and it is possible to create it with a general editor like VS Code and compile it via the command line.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but as a text-based AI, I cannot translate images or texts within images. Please provide the text in Japanese so I can assist you better.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but as a text-based AI, I have no capability to process or translate images. could you please provide the text you want to translate?</p>
<p>Both Rmarkdown and Quarto have an area surrounded by four hyphens at the beginning of the file. This is called a YAML header (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language, indicating that this is not yet a markup area), which is an area to set the entire document.</p>
<p>Upon glancing at this area, you can see things like titles, author names, and output formats listed. The YAML header is sensitive to indentation, and incorrect descriptions can often cause an error, preventing the output file from being generated, so care is needed when manually editing here. However, once you can freely edit this area, various applications become possible, so those who are interested should investigate and try out various things.</p>
<p>Now, there should be a button labeled Knit or Render at the top of the Rmd/Qmd file. When you click this, the conversion to the display file will be executed. [^4.1] In the case of Rmarkdown, it already includes sample code, so an HTML document with numbers and figures is likely to be displayed. Below is to explain using this sample code as an example, I would like you to try Rmarkdown and its compilation (knit) once. Then, let’s check the correspondence between the original Rmd file and the created file.</p>
<p>If the newly opened file has not been named (if it remains as ‘Untitled’), a file name specification screen will open. Also, depending on the environment, you may be asked to download the necessary related packages for compilation the first time you run it.</p>
<p>As an AI, I’m currently unable to process images or text within them. However, if you can provide the Japanese text, I’ll be more than happy to help translate it into English.</p>
<p>Roughly, one can guess what corresponds to what and how it is being converted. At the beginning of the output file, the title, author’s name, date set in YAML are displayed, and the line with the <code>#</code> sign is emphasized as a header.</p>
<p>What I want to pay particular attention to is the gray area surrounded by three quotations in the original file. This area is particularly called <strong>chunks</strong>, where the R script is written and is run at conversion, resulting in output. If you look at the output file, you can see that there is a command statement specified by the <code>summary(cars)</code> chunk, and the result (a summary of the dataset “cars”) is output. To reiterate, the point is that only the script that instructs the calculation is written in the manuscript file, and the output result is not written. The manuscript is just an instruction. By doing so, there will be no errors in copying and pasting, and if you have the same Rmd/Qmd manuscript and data, you can get the same output even on different PCs. It should be clear that by integrating the environment, it contributes to error prevention and reproducibility.</p>
<p>This time, we’re using the sample data <code>cars</code> that R has by default, so the same results are output in any environment. However, of course, even if it’s an individual data file, as long as you’re reading in and processing the same file in the same way, you can track it even if the environment is different. What I want you to keep in mind is that when you compile, it’s done from a new environment. In other words, you <strong>cannot use objects not in the manuscript file</strong>. This is a matter of course in terms of ensuring reproducibility, because even if you start an analysis from “data processed in advance,” you cannot check whether the preprocessing was appropriate. To take advantage of the benefit that if Rmd/Qmd files and raw data such as CSV files are shared, they can be reproduced, all preprocessing including data handling should be written in chunks so that they can be traced from scratch in a new environment. You may find this inconvenient, but I want you to understand that it’s an important procedure as a scientific activity. [^4.2]</p>
<p>However, depending on the version of R and the version of the package, the same results may not be obtained. There may be differences in the more essential computational process. Therefore, efforts are being made to pack and share each version of R and its packages. A system called Docker is an example of a system that conserves and shares the entire analysis environment.</p>
<p>In RStudio, there are various useful features for editing Rmd/Qmd files, such as visual mode, outline display, chunk insertion buttons, and individual chunk execution/settings. It would be good to try various things, referring to sources such as <span class="citation" data-cites="Takahashi201805">高橋 (<a href="#ref-Takahashi201805" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="markdown-notation"><span class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Markdown Notation</h3>
<p>In the following, we will explain the basic usage of Markdown notation.</p>
<p>Certainly, but there is no Japanese text provided here. The text you provided is “Headings and emphasis”. Please provide the text you want to translate.</p>
<p>As already seen, in Markdown, you can create headings using the “#” symbol. The number of “#”s corresponds to the level of the heading, with “#” being the top level, equivalent to what would be called a “chapter” in a book or <code>H1</code> in HTML. It should be noted that a half-width space is required after the “#” symbol. Following this, “section” or <code>H2</code> can be made with <code>##</code>, subsection or <code>H3</code> with <code>###</code>, subsubsection or <code>H4</code> with <code>####</code>… and so on.</p>
<p>You may already be familiar with “paragraph writing” as a way of writing scientific papers, including psychology. Text is hierarchically divided into sections, sub-sections, paragraphs, and sentences. Each division contains four sub-divisions in a textual structure. Particularly in psychology, it is fundamental that a paper is composed of four sections: “Problem,” “Method,” “Result,” and “Discussion.” Writing in consideration of this outline is kind to readers and can naturally be implemented in markdown notation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there may be times when you want to emphasize certain parts in bold or italics. In such cases, you can emphasize them by adding one or two asterisks to <em>highlight</em> or <strong>highlight</strong>.</p>
<section id="figures-and-links" class="level4" data-number="4.0.1.1">
<h4 data-number="4.0.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="figures-and-links"><span class="header-section-number">4.0.1.1</span> Figures and Links</h4>
<p>There may be times when you want to insert figures and tables in the text. To insert a table, you can use Markdown’s unique notation, utilizing vertical bars <code>|</code> and hyphens <code>-</code> to denote it as shown below.</p>
<p>Apologies for the confusion, but I cannot see any Japanese text in your request. Could you provide the Japanese text you’d like translated? I’m sorry, you didn’t provide any Japanese text for translation. Could you please enter the text you need translated? I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you would like translated? I’m sorry, but your input does not contain Japanese text that could be translated into English. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want to be translated? Sorry, I can’t see any Japanese text that I should translate. Could you please provide the Japanese text you’d like me to translate into English?</p>
<p>Sorry, I’m unable to translate from Japanese as the provided text is not visible. Could you please provide the Japanese text you need translated into English?</p>
<p>There are functions within the R code that output analysis results in markdown format, and if you have a table created in spreadsheet software, using a generative AI like chatGPT can quickly convert the format for you. It would be beneficial to utilize such tools.</p>
<p>Inserting a figure in Markdown can be thought of as a link to the figure’s file. As follows, characters enclosed in square brackets will be the caption, and the one enclosed in parentheses will be the link to the figure. When it is actually displayed, the figure will be shown.</p>
<p>Sorry, but you did not provide any Japanese text for me to translate into English. Please paste the text that you would like translated. I’m sorry, but your text has not been provided. Please provide a Japanese text to be translated into English. I’m sorry, but there seems to be some misunderstanding. There is no text provided for me to translate from Japanese to English. Can you please provide the Japanese text that needs to be translated?</p>
<p>Similarly, links to websites can also be handled in the format of <code>[display name](link destination)</code>.</p>
<p>Please provide the Japanese text you’d like to be translated into English.</p>
<p>When you want to list things in parallel, list them with a plus or minus sign. Be aware that you should insert a line break before and after the list.</p>
<p>You haven’t provided any Japanese text. Please provide the text you’d like me to translate. Translation: Until the previous sentence</p>
<p>Apologies, but there isn’t any Japanese text provided to translate into English. Please provide the text you’d like me to translate. I’m sorry, but no Japanese text has been provided to translate. Could you please provide the text you’d like translated? I’m sorry for any inconvenience, but there seems to be a mistake. Please provide Japanese text you want me to translate. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text? I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the text you want translated?</p>
<p>Please provide the Japanese text to be translated into English. I’m sorry, you seem to have forgotten to input the Japanese text you want translated to English.</p>
<p>Sorry, I can’t proceed with the translation as there’s no Japanese text provided in your request. Could you please provide the Japanese text?</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the area called a “chunk” is where the executed code is written. A chunk is first indicated as a code block by connecting three backslashes, then written with ‘r’ to explicitly state that the computation engine is R. It is also possible to specify other computation engines such as Julia or Python here.</p>
<p>If possible, it is a good idea to give a chunk name. The following example is one where “chunksample” has been given as the chunk name. If you name a chunk, you can also move using the heading jump in RStudio, which is convenient when editing.</p>
<p>Sorry, I can’t help with that because there’s no Japanese text provided. Sure, but I’ll need the Japanese text to proceed with the translation. Sure, I would be happy to help, but seems like the Japanese text isn’t provided for translation. Could you please provide it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to specify chunk options like <code>echo = FALSE</code>. The <code>echo=FALSE</code> option is used to display only the results, not the input script. Other specifications such as “do not include calculation results” and “perform calculations without displaying them” are also possible.</p>
<p>In Quarto, you can also write this chunk option in the following way.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but there doesn’t seem to be any Japanese text provided for translation. Could you possibly provide the text you want translated? You didn’t attach any Japanese text to be translated. Please provide the text you want translated into English. You didn’t provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text that needs to be translated. You didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate.

<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-drawing-with-plots"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Basic Drawing with Plots</h2>
<p>From the perspective of reproducible documents, it is important to represent figures and tables by script descriptions.</p>
<p>Always be mindful to <strong>visualize data first</strong>. Visualization provides a lot of information that cannot be fully grasped by a series of numbers or aggregated statistics, and potentially allows to intuitively find latent relationships. Therefore, there is no mistake in thinking that <strong>every data collected should be visualized first</strong>. I said it twice because it’s important. Please also refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="Kieran2018">キーラン・ヒーリー (<a href="#ref-Kieran2018" role="doc-biblioref">[2018] 2021</a>)</span>, who touches upon the importance of visualization in psychological findings.</p>
<p>Now, R has a basic drawing environment, and by simply giving variables corresponding to the x-axis and y-axis as arguments to a function called ‘plot’, it can easily draw a scatter plot for you.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, there’s no Japanese text presented for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you want translated to English? I can translate Japanese to English for you without any problem. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Unfortunately, you haven’t provided any Japanese text for translation. Please provide Japanese text for me to translate into English. Sorry, the text you provided is in a programming language (presumably R), not Japanese. The translation of this line would be “Label of the x-axis is ‘Sepal.Length’”, if this code was to be described in English. Please provide a Japanese text for translation. Sure, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Could you please enter the text you want to be translated? Since you haven’t provided any Japanese text, I can’t translate. Could you please send the text you need to be translated? As a translator, I’ll need the Japanese text in order to translate it into English. Could you please provide it?</p>
<p>As an option of this function, you can give a title or name to the axis. You can also change various operations such as the shape of the plotted pins, the drawing color, and the background color. Even without a specific package, it can be said that it has basic drawing capabilities.</p>

<section id="drawing-with-ggplot" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drawing-with-ggplot"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Drawing with ggplot</h2>
<p>Here, we learn to draw using the ‘ggplot2’ package, a drawing specific package included in ‘tidyverse’. While quite a lot can be done with R’s basic drawing functions, the figures drawn using this ‘ggplot2’ package are more beautiful and can be operated intuitively. This is because the ‘gg’ in ‘ggplot’ stands for ‘The Grammar of Graphics’, indicating that it allows logical control over illustrations. The scripts of the figures described in ‘ggplot2’ form have high readability and are visually beautiful, thus they are used in many documents.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the drawing environment provided by the <code>ggplot2</code> package is the concept of layers. The plot is represented as a stack of multiple layers. First, there is a base canvas, and on top of it, datasets, geometric objects (points, lines, bars, etc.), aesthetic mapping (colors, shapes, sizes, etc.), legends, and captions are layered. This is the concept. By managing the theme throughout the plot, finishing touches such as unifying the color palette can be done, so that a plot of a level that can be immediately submitted to a paper can be drawn.</p>
<p>The text translates to:</p>
<p>Below is a sample drawing in <code>ggplot2</code>. I used the sample data <code>mtcars</code>.</p>
<p>Sorry, I can’t view the Japanese text. Please try again by providing the text you want translated. I’m sorry, but I cannot translate an image file. Could you please provide a text input?</p>
<p>Apologies for the confusion, but it seems you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you’d like to be translated.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but the text you provided seems to be code used in a programming language, not Japanese. Can you please provide the correct content for translation? I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate into English. Please provide the desired phrase. You didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you want to be translated. labs(title = “Relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency”, x = “Weight”, y = “Fuel Efficiency”) Apologies for the misunderstanding. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate into English?</p>
<p>First of all, I want you to grasp the beauty of the completed diagram and the image of the code. The first ‘library(ggplot2)’ is where the package is being loaded. This time, ‘ggplot2’ is explicitly being loaded, but it is also loaded at the same time when the ‘tidyverse’ package is loaded. So, if you get into the habit of writing ‘library(tidyverse)’ at the beginning of your R script, you will not need it.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll notice that the <code>ggplot</code> function is written across four lines, each connected by a <code>+</code> sign. This corresponds to the process of layering the layout. First, prepare a canvas to draw the figure, and then layer various elements on top of it.</p>
<p>The following code is an example that only draws the canvas.</p>
<p>You’ve forgotten to add the Japanese text you need translated into English. Could you please provide it? Sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated. I’m sorry but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you would like translated. As a language model, I’m unable to process images or text inside your request. Could you please type out the Japanese text you need translated?</p>
<p>Here, we created an object called <code>g</code> using the <code>ggplot</code> function, and displayed it. At first, it’s just a plain canvas, but we’re going to keep overwriting it with something new.</p>
<p>Geometric object geom</p>
<p>A geometric object is a specification of how data is represented, and various patterns are prepared in <code>ggplot</code>. Here is an example.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>geom_point()</code></strong>: Used in scatter plots, this plots data points individually.</li>
<li><strong><code>geom_line()</code></strong>: This is used in line graphs, it plots by connecting data points with lines. It is often used for time series data.</li>
<li><strong><code>geom_bar()</code></strong>: Used in bar graphs, it represents the amount for each category with a bar. It is suitable for aggregating data (such as counts or totals).</li>
<li><strong><code>geom_histogram()</code></strong>: Used in histograms, it displays the distribution of continuous data in bars. It is useful for understanding the distribution of data.</li>
<li><strong><code>geom_boxplot()</code></strong>: Used in box and whisker plots, it summarizes and displays the distribution of data (medians, quartiles, outliers, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>geom_smooth()</code></strong>: Adds a smoothing curve to visualize trends or patterns in the data. Methods such as linear regression or low pass filters are used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Draw these geometric objects by specifying correspondences with data and axes, etc. The following is a dot plot by <code>geom_point</code>, which is a scatter plot.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but I didn’t see any Japanese text included in your request. Could you please provide the Japanese text you’d like translated? Apologies for the confusion, it seems like you haven’t provided any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want to be translated. As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I’m incapable of translating code as it’s already in a universal language. However, the snippet you provided appears to be written in R programming language, not Japanese. It is using ggplot2 to create a scatter plot of the ‘mtcars’ dataset with ‘disp’ (displacement) on the x-axis and ‘wt’ (weight) on the y-axis. Here’s its description in plain English:</p>
<p>“Create a scatter plot using the ‘mtcars’ dataset, mapping displacement (‘disp’) to the x-axis and weight (‘wt’) to the y-axis.” I’m sorry, but you forgot to input the Japanese text you need translated into English. Could you provide the text, please?</p>
<p>In the first line, a canvas is prepared and points are plotted on it using <code>geom_point</code>. At this time, the data is <code>mtcars</code>, and the variable <code>disp</code> is mapped to the x-axis and the variable <code>wt</code> to the y-axis. The mapping function <code>aes</code> stands for aesthetic mappings, which allows you to specify values (x coordinates, y coordinates, color, size, transparency, etc.) that change depending on the data.</p>
<p>Layers can be overlaid one after another. Let’s take a look at the following example.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but it seems you forgot to include the Japanese text that you would like me to translate into English. Could you please provide the text? Apologies for the misunderstanding, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Please provide the text you’d like translated into English. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide a Japanese text. The piece you’ve given appears to be a line of code. Please provide a Japanese text for translation. Apologies for any confusion, but as an AI language model, I didn’t receive a Japanese text that needs translation. The text you provided seems to be code and not a piece of text in a human language. Please provide the Japanese text that needs to be translated into English. I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. Could you please write the text you want to be translated? Certainly, please provide the Japanese text that you would like to have translated into English.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the layering, we have set up the <code>g</code> objects one after another, but of course you can write them all at once with one object, and you can output directly as shown in the first example without storing as a <code>g</code> object. Also, here we are layering the line drawing object on the point drawing object, but the data and mapping are exactly the same. When writing different data on one canvas, it is possible to specify each geometric object like this, but the canvas often ends up with one type of data. In such cases, it is possible to provide the basic data set and mapping from the stage of the canvas, as shown below.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text. Could you please send the text you want to translate into English? Apologies for the confusion, but there seems to be no Japanese text provided. Could you kindly provide the text you want to be translated? I’m sorry, but what you provided isn’t Japanese text, it’s a line of code used in data analysis. Could you please provide a Japanese text for translation? I’m sorry, but the text provided is not in Japanese. It seems to be a part of a code script(e.g., ggplot in R) and not text in Japanese language. Unfortunately, I can’t translate that into English for you. I’m sorry for the confusion, but “geom_line()” seems to be a command in R programming language, not a Japanese phrase I can translate. As a language model AI, I’m unable to process or translate a text if it’s not provided. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate?</p>
<p>Also, in this example, the first argument of the <code>ggplot</code> function is the dataset, so it can be passed with the pipe operator. I’m sorry, I’m unable to translate Japanese text without the actual text. Could you please provide the text you would like translated? Sorry, I can’t see any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you need translated? Unfortunately, this text doesn’t look like Japanese. It’s code, more specifically from the programming language R. Please provide a Japanese text you would like to translate. Unfortunately, you have provided code instead of Japanese text. Could you please provide the Japanese text that you need translating into English? I’m sorry but I can’t translate this as text provided is not in Japanese. It seems to be a part of a code in a programming language possibly R (used for data visualization). If it is a mistake, please provide the actual Japanese text you want to be translated. I’m sorry but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Kindly provide the Japanese text and I’ll be happy to assist. Of course, I’d be happy to translate. However, you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. Can you please provide it?</p>
<p>By using the pipe operator, it becomes possible to handle raw data, shape it into the required form, and visualize it in a way that can be read on script. As you get used to it, you’ll start identifying elements you want to visualize from the data set and imagine how to shape them so they can be easily passed to <code>ggplot</code>. To do this, you need to draw an image of the target figure in your head and be able to reverse engineer the figure or write down the steps to create it, such as what the x-axis and y-axis of the figure are, what type of geometric objects are on it etc. This is similar to being able to gather the ingredients needed for a dish you want to eat and figure out the general process (from prep to cooking). When actually writing down the recipe, it’s good to leverage the power of AI, and even then, you should instruct from the final target and overall design direction, and add fine-tuning as necessary.</p>
<p>The following illustrates an example of data handling and drawing. Since comments are attached to each step, check the flow of processing and drawing as if reading a sentence, and compare it with the output results.</p>

<p>It might sound repetitive, but this code is not something you can write right away until you get used to it. What’s important is whether you can “visualize the output result”, “decompose it into elements”, and “arrange it according to the procedure”. [^4.3]</p>
<p>In reality, the code was generated by instructing chatGPT version 4. Instead of suddenly painting the whole picture, it is effective to gradually append it.</p>

<p>Finally, let me mention some drawing techniques. You can search for these online as needed, or ask the AI generator, but it’s also important to have a basic knowledge that these techniques exist. For more details on drawing, you should refer to Chapter 4 of <span class="citation" data-cites="Kinosady2021">松村 et al. (<a href="#ref-Kinosady2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>There may be times when you want to arrange multiple plots on a single panel. For example, in the previously mentioned <code>mtcars</code> data, there are two levels to the <code>am</code> variable - automatic and manual cars. This is a case where we would want to divide the graph for each such subgroup.</p>
<p>In times like these, the functions <code>facet_wrap</code> and <code>facet_grid</code> are useful. The former splits the diagram for a variable, and the latter splits the diagram for two variables.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but there’s no Japanese text provided for me to translate. The text you’ve given seems to be a script in R programming language. Can you provide the correct Japanese text you’d like me to translate? Apologies for the confusion, but there doesn’t seem to be any Japanese text given to translate into English. Could you please provide the text you want to be translated? I’m sorry, but no Japanese text was provided. Can you please input the text you need translated? filename = “my_plot.png”, # The name of the file to save. As an AI, I need the Japanese text you’re looking to translate. Unfortunately, I can’t translate an unspecified text or the given text as it seems to be a line of code, not a Japanese phrase to translate. Please provide the actual Japanese text for translation. Sorry, there isn’t any Japanese text provided for translation. The content in the above message seems to be a comment in programming code. Can you please provide the text that needs to be translated? path = “path/to/directory”, # Path to the directory where the file is saved scale = 1, # Graphics enlargement/reduction ratio width = 5, # The width of the plot to be saved (in inches) height = 5, # The height of the plot to be saved (in inches) Sorry, you seem to have forgotten to share the Japanese text you would like translated. Please try again, and I’ll do my best to translate it for you. I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text for translation. Could you please provide the text you want translated? You haven’t provided any Japanese text for me to translate. Please provide the Japanese text and I will do my best to translate it into English.</p>
<p>Change of Theme (To Match The Report)</p>
<p>There may be times when you need to express figures in monochrome, such as when submitting reports or papers. In <code>ggplot</code>, colors are automatically assigned, which is due to the selection of a default paint set (also known as a <strong>palette</strong>). Changing this set will result in the same plot being output in different colors. The palette to use when you want to output in monochrome (grayscale) is <code>Grays</code>.</p>
<p>Apologies, but the Japanese text to be translated is not attached in your request. Could you please provide it? I’m sorry, but I can’t translate the text as it is not provided. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want translated into English? # Plot in Grayscale I’m sorry, but the text you provided appears to be a code snippet in the R programming language, not Japanese. Is there anything else you’d like me to translate? Apologies for the misunderstanding, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text so I can assist you better. As a language model AI, I’m unable to directly translate a code. The statement you have given is a piece of code in R language used for setting the grey color palette in a plot, it is not a Japanese text that can be translated into English. You didn’t provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want translated into English.</p>

<p>I’m sorry but the text provided doesn’t seem to be Japanese. It’s a piece of code related to R, a programming language. The command is for loading the ‘RColorBrewer’ package in R. Considering Color Vision Characteristics in a Color Palette You haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. However, it seems like your text is a piece of coding script. Could you please provide the Japanese text that you would like me to translate? I’m sorry but your text seems to be a snippet of coding, not Japanese.

<p>Also, by default in <code>ggplot2</code>, the background color is gray. This is because the overall theme is set to <code>theme_gray()</code>. However, if you look at the example of the graph described in the <a href="https://psych.or.jp/manual/">Writing/Submission Guide</a> of the Japanese Psychological Association, the background is set to white. In order to change to such settings, you can use theme_classic() or theme_bw().</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but you forgot to provide the Japanese text you want me to translate. Your sentence seems to be a line of code rather than Japanese text. Could you provide the Japanese text you would like translated? For me to translate the Japanese text into English, please provide the text you’d like translated.</p>
<p>In addition, various design improvements can be considered. If the elements can be decomposed to write down the recipe for the target diagram, it can solve most of the cases.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Please load <code>Baseball.csv</code>, limit it to the 2020 fiscal year dataset, and prepare the dataset <code>dat.tb</code> with any necessary variable conversions completed.</li>
<li>Please draw a histogram using the height variable of <code>dat.tb</code>. Meanwhile, set the theme to <code>theme_classic</code>.</li>
<li>Please draw a scatter diagram using the height and weight variables of <code>dat.tb</code>. At this time, please set the theme to <code>theme_bw</code>.</li>
<li>(Continued from before) Please color each point in the scatter plot according to blood type. At this time, please change the color palette to <code>Set3</code>.</li>
<li>(Following the previous) Please change the shape of the points in the scatter plot according to blood types.</li>
<li>Please divide the scatter plot of height and weight in <code>dat.tb</code> by team.</li>
<li>(Following from before) Please use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to draw a smooth line. There’s no need to specify <code>method</code> in particular.</li>
<li>(Continued) Please draw a linear function using <code>geom_smooth()</code>. It would be good to specify <code>method="lm"</code>.</li>
<li>Please plot the average weight against height on the x and y axes respectively. There are various methods, but you can also apply functions within geometric objects like this after calculating the summary statistics to create another dataset <code>dat.tb2</code>. Hint: <code>geom_point(stat="summary", fun=mean)</code>.</li>
<li>Please write the code to create the plot below using the histograms of Problem 2, 4 and weight, and save it using the <code>ggsave</code> function. The file name and other options are up to you.</li>

<p>I’m sorry, but the text you’ve provided is not Japanese. It appears to be a code for reading a CSV file named “Baseball.csv”. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, but the provided text seems to be code from programming language, likely R for data filtering, not Japanese. And “2020年度” is Japanese for “Fiscal Year 2020” or “Year 2020” depending on the context. Could you please provide a correct Japanese text that needs to be translated? Sorry, you didn’t provide any Japanese text. Please provide the text you want translated into English. Histogram of height (rotated 90 degrees to the right) Apologies, it appears there was a misunderstanding. The text you provided seems to be a code snippet from a programming language, possibly R. As an AI, I am capable of translating code into English by explaining what it does. However, you asked for a Japanese to English translation. Could you please provide the Japanese text? You didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Please provide the text you want translated. Sorry, I can’t translate this as it appears to be a coding command, not Japanese text.
