<p>In psychology, and in any science that deals with data, there is a process of “processing data into an understandable form, visualizing it, and analyzing it” between the planning and execution of data collection, the analytical results based on the data, and the communication based on those results. This processing of data is called <strong>data handling</strong>. Although statistics tend to be associated with “analysis”, in reality, the steps of data handling and visualization are the most time-consuming and crucial processes.</p>
<section id="introduction-to-tidyverse" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-tidyverse"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction to tidyverse</h2>
<p>In this lecture, we will cover data handling using <code>tidyverse</code>. <code>tidyverse</code> is a concept that represents a unified design policy for data, and it is also the name of the package that implements it. First, install (download) the <code>tidyverse</code> package, and load it into R with the following code.</p>
<p>You forgot to provide the Japanese text you want to translate. Could you please provide it? It seems like an error occurred, as no Japanese text was provided needing translation. Can you please provide the Japanese text you want translated into English? Sure, I can help you with that. Please provide the Japanese text to be translated.</p>
<p>The message “Attaching core tidyverse packages,” is displayed, and you would have seen a list of package names with check marks. The <code>tidyverse</code> package is a group of packages that includes these sub-packages. The <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code> packages included in this are used for data manipulation, <code>readr</code> for file reading, <code>forecats</code> for operating Factor-type variables, <code>stringr</code> for character-type variables, <code>lubridate</code> for date-type variables, <code>tibble</code> for operating data frame type objects, <code>purrr</code> for functions to apply to data, and <code>ggplot2</code> is a package specialized for visualization.</p>
<p>Next, there is a mention about Conflicts. This warning, which may be displayed when loading packages, not limited to the <code>tidyverse</code> package, signifies a “function name conflict”. Until now, just by starting R, functions like <code>sqrt</code>, <code>mean</code>, etc. were available for use. While these are R’s basic functions, they are specifically functions included in the <code>base</code> package. R automatically loads several packages, including <code>base</code>, at startup. When additional packages are loaded after this, occasionally those loaded later might use functions of the same name. At this point, the function names are overwritten by those loaded later. This warning is displayed to inform about this situation. Specifically, “<code>dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()</code>” means that the <code>filter</code> function of the <code>stats</code> package, which was loaded initially, is overwritten by the function with the same name from the <code>dplyr</code> package (included in the <code>tidyverse</code> package), and from now on, this will be given priority for use.</p>
<p>Such homographs can cause confusion when specifying functions. If you want to clearly indicate that it is a function of a certain package, it is good to write it as “packageName::functionName”, as stated in this warning.</p>

<section id="pipe-operator" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pipe-operator"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Pipe Operator</h2>
<p>Next, let’s explain about the pipe operator. The pipe operator was introduced in the <code>magrittr</code> package included in the <code>tidyverse</code> package, which greatly improved the convenience of data handling. Therefore, R also introduced this operator from version 4.2, and it became usable without requiring the installation of a specific package. This native R pipe operator is sometimes called ‘naive pipe’ to distinguish it from the <code>tidyverse</code> one.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s explain how excellent this pipe operator is. The following script calculates the standard deviation of a dataset[^3.1]. It is expressed by the following formula. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the arithmetic mean of the data vector <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. As an AI language model, I’m unable to translate mathematical expressions. However, I can tell you that the given formula is the standard deviation formula written in Notation of Summation. It’s not a Japanese text that requires translation. It stands for:</p>
<p>“v is equal to the square root of the sum for i equals 1 through n of (x_i - x_bar) squared, divided by n”</p>
<p>Of course, this could be done with just one line <code>sd(dat)</code>, but I’m writing each step here for explanation. The most important thing is that what is calculated with the <code>sd</code> function is the square root of the unbiased variance divided by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>, which is different from the sample standard deviation.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but as a text-based model, I can’t translate Japanese or any other language texts without you providing the actual text. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want me to translate? dat &lt;- c(10, 13, 15, 12, 14) # Data M &lt;- mean(dat) # Average dev &lt;- dat - M # Mean deviation pow &lt;- dev^2 # Square of average deviation variance &lt;- mean(pow) # The mean of the square of the average deviation is the variance standardDev &lt;- sqrt(variance) # The positive square root of variance is the standard deviation I’m sorry, but without any Japanese text provided, I am unable to assist you. Could you please provide the text you would like translated?</p>
<p>Here, we reach the answer by creating four objects: a mean object <code>M</code>, a deviation vector <code>dev</code>, that vector squared <code>pow</code>, and the variance <code>variance</code>, before creating a standard deviation object <code>standardDev</code>. Also, since the objects being created are on the left and the operations being performed on them are described on the right, it’s likely read in one’s mind as, “Create an object, then do the next calculation.”</p>
<p>The pipe operator embodies this flow of thought as is. The pipe operator is written as <code>%&gt;%</code>, and its role is to pass the result of the operation on the left side as the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe operator. Let’s rewrite the script above considering this. By the way, the pipe operator can be input with the shortcut <code>Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+M</code>.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you’d like translated? You didn’t provide any Japanese text. The given statement “dat &lt;- c(10, 13, 15, 12, 14)” is a code in R language to create a data vector, not a Japanese text. Please provide the Japanese text you want to translate. I’m sorry, but this passage seems to be composed in R programming language, not Japanese. Could you please provide a Japanese text to translate instead? As an AI, I can’t see the text you’d like me to translate. Could you please type it out? Sorry, there’s no text to translate. Please provide a Japanese text that you need translated into English.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text for me to translate. Could you please provide the text you want me to translate into English? You didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text for me to assist you. I’m sorry, but I can’t provide the translation because you haven’t provided any Japanese text. Could you please provide the Japanese text you want to translate into English? I’m sorry, I didn’t get any Japanese text to translate into English. Could you please provide the text? I apologize but there seems to be some confusion. The string you’ve given is not Japanese text, it appears to be some sort of code snippet. Please provide a Japanese text so that I can translate it into English for you. I’m sorry, but it seems there is no Japanese text provided for me to translate. Could you please provide the Japanese text you’d like translated into English? Sorry, I’m not able to help as you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text for translation.</p>
<p>The period (<code>.</code>) here is a placeholder inherited from the previous function, and the second line means <code>{dat - mean(dat)}</code>, i.e., the calculation of the mean deviation. This is squared in the next pipe, then the mean is calculated, and then the square root is taken. The placeholder is not explicitly shown when taking means and square roots because it is obvious where the inherited argument will be placed, and therefore it is omitted.</p>
<p>As seen in this example, by using the pipe operator, the flow of calculation of data -&gt; mean deviation -&gt; squaring -&gt; mean -&gt; square root and the flow of the script match, making it easier to understand, right?</p>
<p>Also, the calculations here can be written as follows.</p>
<p>Sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text. Please provide the text you’d like to translate. I’m sorry, but the text you provided is not Japanese. It’s a line of code in the R programming language. It calculates the standard deviation of a dataset referred to as “dat”. Sure, but you forgot to provide the Japanese text that you want me to translate. Could you please provide that for me before I start translating?</p>
<p>This writing style involves nesting functions within functions, in a form such as <span class="math inline">\(y = h(g(f(x)))\)</span>. This also requires interpretation from the inside of the corresponding brackets, making it difficult to understand because it is the reverse of the flow of thought. Using the pipe operator, you can describe it as <code>x %&gt;% f() %&gt;% g() %&gt;% h() -&gt; y</code>, making it easy to read without any trouble.</p>
<p>We will proceed with the description using this pipe operator, so let’s get used to this notation (and shortcut).</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text you want translated into English.</p>
<p>Let’s confirm in the help that the <code>sqrt</code> and <code>mean</code> functions are included in the ‘base’ package. Where should we look? What about the <code>filter</code> and <code>lag</code> functions? By loading the <code>tidyverse</code> package, the <code>filter</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package has become the priority. Let’s look at the <code>filter</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package in the help. Let’s take a look at the help for the <code>filter</code> function in the <code>stats</code> package before it gets overwritten. Let’s use the data from earlier to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MeanAD) and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) using the pipe operator. The Mean Absolute Deviation and the Median Absolute Deviation are defined as follows. The R function for calculating the absolute value is <code>abs</code>.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but there seems to be an error in the text provided. It appears to be a mathematical equation instead of Japanese text. The mathematical equation represents the formula of Mean Absolute Deviation. However, if you have any Japanese text which needs to be translated, please feel free to share! You’ve given me a mathematical formula, which doesn’t need translation as it is universal. Here is how you can decipher it:</p>
<p>MAD stands for Mean Absolute Deviation. This is a formula to calculate it in a data set.</p>
<p>“x_1, …, x_n” are data points in the set. “median(x)” is the median of the data set.</p>
<p>The formula calculates the median of the absolute values of the differences between each data point and the median of the data set.</p>
<p>Sure, here is the translation:</p>

<p>From here on, we will discuss more specific data handling using <code>tidyverse</code>. First, consider extracting only specific columns and rows. It is useful when you want to process only a part of the data.</p>
<p>“Column Selection”</p>
<p>The function for column selection is <code>select</code>. This is included in the <code>dplyr</code> package within the <code>tidyverse</code> package. Be careful as the <code>select</code> function is often included in other packages such as the <code>MASS</code> package.</p>
<p>For illustration, we will use the sample data <code>iris</code> that R has by default. Note that the <code>iris</code> data has 150 rows so we use the <code>head</code> function to display the beginning of the dataset in the following, but you do not have to use <code>head</code> in the exercises. Sure, however, you didn’t provide any Japanese text for me to translate. If you send the text, I’d be happy to assist you. # Checking the iris data Sorry, as a text translation AI, I can’t process codes or commands, but I can translate a Japanese text into English.

<p>The <strong>regular expression</strong> mentioned here is a notation rule for specifying patterns to identify strings. This is not only used in R language, but also in other programming languages. It can also be used in bibliographic searches, expressing arbitrary strings, words at the beginning or end, etc., using symbols (meta characters). For more details, search for regular expressions. For example, <a href="https://userweb.mnet.ne.jp/nakama/">this site</a> is easy to understand.</p>

<p>Generally, since variables are arranged in columns in a dataframe, column selection with the <code>select</code> function can also be said to be variable selection. In contrast, observations are lined up in the row direction, so row selection is the selection of observations (cases, entities). The <code>filter</code> function of <code>dplyr</code> is used for row selection.</p>

<p>Here, <code>==</code> is an operator used to determine if they match. If you use only one <code>=</code>, it becomes the same as “assignment to an object”, so it is written twice when determining conditions. Similarly, <code>!=</code> is the operator that becomes true when there is a not equal, in other words, a mismatch.</p>
<p>Please provide the Japanese text you’d like me to translate into English.</p>
<p>Creating another variable from an existing variable or reassigning values is one of the most common operations during data handling. For example, one may transform a continuous variable into a categorical variable as “high group and low group” at some value, or perform linear transformation for unit conversion. When manipulating variables, the operation of “producing features by processing existing variables” basically uses the <code>mutate</code> function of <code>dplyr</code>. Let’s take a look at the following example.</p>
<p>Sorry, there was no Japanese text provided. Please submit the text you’d like to be translated. Your text appears to be in the programming language ‘R’, and not in Japanese. The translation into English would be: “Mutate the ‘iris’ dataset such that a new column ‘Twice’ is added, which is the ‘Sepal.Length’ column times 2, then display the first six rows of this modified dataset”. I’m sorry, there seems to be some misunderstanding, I cannot translate anything without the actual Japanese text. Please provide the content you want me to translate.</p>
<p>You can confirm that a new <code>Twice</code> variable has been created. This function can be used within the pipe operator (in fact, that’s its main use). The next example divides the <code>Sepal.Length</code> variable into two groups, high and low.</p>
<p>For me to properly translate, you’ll need to provide the Japanese text you’d like translated into English. As an AI, I’m unable to translate anything without being provided the actual Japanese text. Could you please provide me with the Japanese text you want me to translate? Sorry, but the text you’ve provided seems to be related to R (programming language) syntax rather than Japanese. Could you please provide the Japanese text for translation? Apologies for the confusion, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text to translate into English. Please provide the text for translation. Sorry, it seems there is a misunderstanding. The text you provided is a code snippet, not Japanese text. This code appears to be written in R for data manipulation with dplyr package. It is modifying a “Sepal.HL” column in a dataset to factor variables with labels “High” and “Low”. Please provide a Japanese text for me to translate it to English. I apologize for any confusion, but you haven’t provided any Japanese text that needs to be translated to English. Could you please provide the text? I’m here to help! I’m sorry, but I can’t translate the text as there is no Japanese text provided in your request. Please provide the text you want to be translated.</p>
<p>The <code>ifelse</code> function used here is a conditional branching function used in the form of <code>if(condition judgement, processing when true, processing when false)</code>. In this case, it returns 1 if it is larger than the average, and 2 otherwise. The <code>mutate</code> function assigns (generates) this result to the Sepal.HL variable, and the next <code>mutate</code> function converts the newly created Sepal.HL variable to the Factor type and assigns (overwrites) the result back to the Sepal.HL variable. By keeping the destination for variable generation the same as the source, it will be overwritten, so it can be used for variable type conversion (such as from string type to numeric type, or from numeric type to Factor type), for example.</p>

<p>Let’s read in <code>Baseball.csv</code> and assign it to the data frame <code>df</code>. The <code>df</code> contains multiple variables. The list of variable names is done with the <code>names</code> function. Let’s check the variable names contained in the <code>df</code> object. There are many variables in <code>df</code>, but the ones we need are Year, Player Name, Team, Height, Weight, Salary, and Position. Let’s select these variables and create a <code>df2</code> object that consists only of them. The data contained in <code>df2</code> includes several years of data. Since we only want to analyze the data for the <code>2020 fiscal year</code>, let’s try selecting it. Let’s try to select only the data related to the <code>Hanshin Tigers</code> from the same <code>fiscal year 2020</code>. How can we select datasets other than the “Hanshin Tigers” from the fiscal year 2020? Let’s create a BMI variable that represents the physical characteristics of the athlete. Note that BMI is calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m). Be aware that the unit of the <code>height</code> variable is in cm. Let’s try making a new variable <code>position2</code> to distinguish between pitchers and fielders. This will be a factor type. Note, fielders are those not pitchers, in other words, either infielders, outfielders, or catchers. The professional baseball world in Japan is largely divided into the Central League (C-League) and the Pacific League (P-League). The teams belonging to the Central League are Giants, Carp, Tigers, Swallows, Dragons, and DeNA, and everything else is the Pacific League. Let’s try creating a ‘League’ variable that represents the league each team belongs to, using the ‘df2’. Let’s also make this variable a Factor type. The variable <code>Year</code> is in string format because it has the suffix “Fiscal Year”, which is inconvenient when actually using it. Let’s convert it to a numeric variable by removing the “Fiscal Year” characters.</p>

<p>The data we have seen so far was stored in two dimensions of the matrix, in the form of case × variables. This format is easy for humans to understand and manage, but not necessarily so for computers. For example, as is sometimes derisively referred to as “God Excel,” there are instances where the spreadsheet software is used as if it were graph paper or manuscript paper software. This might be easy to understand (easy to grasp at a glance) for humans, but since computers cannot grasp the structure, it is not suitable for data analysis. There are still many electronic data in the world that are difficult to analyze in this way.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this, in December 2020, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications established a unified rule for the notation of machine-readable data <span class="citation" data-cites="soumu">(<a href="#ref-soumu" role="doc-biblioref">総務省 2020</a>)</span>. It includes the following checklist items.</p>
<p>Is the file format in Excel or CSV? Is it one data per cell? Numerical data should be treated as numerical attributes, and should not contain any strings. Are you sure you haven’t merged the cells? Please ensure that you have not formatted the text with spaces, line breaks, etc. Are you not abbreviating the item name? If you are using formulas, have you made corrections to the numerical data? Are you not using the object? Is the unit of data mentioned? Are you sure you are not using machine-dependent characters? Please ensure whether the data isn’t segmented. Is there more than one table listed on the sheet?</p>
<p>The basic principle of data entry can be said to be <strong>creating a single dataset with no more or less than one case of information per line</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the concept of <strong>tidy data</strong>, promoted by <span class="citation" data-cites="Hadley2014">Hadley (<a href="#ref-Hadley2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, is about the form of data that is easy for computers to analyze. Tidy data is a data format that has the following four characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable forms one column.</li>
<li>Each observation forms one row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms one table. Each value forms one cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the data is in this format, it becomes easy for the computer to grasp the correspondence structure of variables and values, and it turns into data that is easy to analyze. It is no exaggeration to say that the purpose of data handling is to sort out the disordered miscellaneous data into the form of easy-to-use orderly data. Now, if we think about it carefully, we realize that variable names are also one type of variable. Generally, matrix type data is in the following format.</p>
<div class="line-block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Late night |</div>
<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t see the Japanese text you need translated. Can you please send it again? | Tokyo | Clear | Clear | Rain | Rain | | Osaka | Clear | Cloudy | Clear | Clear | | Fukuoka | Clear | Cloudy | Cloudy | Rain | Long type data</p>
<p>For example, when trying to view the weather in Osaka in the evening, it’s clear that it’s “sunny”. At this time, the line of sight moves in a way that it refers to the Osaka line and evening column. Put another way, when referring to the “sunny” weather of Osaka in the evening, it’s necessary to refer to the labels of both rows and columns.</p>
<p>Let’s try rearranging the same data here in the following way.</p>
<div class="line-block">Area | Time Zone | Weather |</div>
<p>Apologies, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text to translate. Please provide the text for me to help you with the translation. | Tokyo | Morning | Sunny | | Tokyo | Afternoon | Sunny | | Tokyo | Evening | Rain | | Tokyo | Late Night | Rain | | Osaka | Morning | Sunny | | Osaka | Afternoon | Cloudy | | Osaka | Evening | Clear | | Osaka | Midnight | Clear |</p>
<div class="line-block">Fukuoka | Morning | Sunny |<br>
Fukuoka | Afternoon | Cloudy |<br>
Fukuoka | Evening | Cloudy |<br>
Fukuoka | Late night | Rain |</div>
<p>Long type data</p>
<p>The information represented by this data is the same, but narrowing down the conditions to Osaka and evening can be done just by selecting rows, which is easy for a computer. This format is called long format data, or “column-wise” data. On the other hand, the former format is called wide format data, or “row-wise” data.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using long format data is how it handles missing values. If there are missing values in wide format data, deleting entire rows or columns can be wasteful. Besides, identifying both rows and columns can be technically cumbersome. On the other hand, with long format data, one can easily just delete the specific row with missing data.</p>
<p>In <code>tidyverse</code> (specifically in <code>tidyr</code>), there are prepared functions for converting such long format data and wide format data. Let’s look at it with an actual example. First, ‘pivot_longer’, which transforms wide data into long format.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but I can’t help you with this since I haven’t received the Japanese text you mentioned. Please provide the text in order to proceed with the translation. I’m sorry but the text you provided is not in Japanese, it appears to be a line of code written in R programming language for reshaping data using the pivot_longer function from the “tidyverse” package, specifically the “dplyr” package. The code is basically taking the “iris” dataset and reshaping it into a longer format where “Species” is not included in the reshaping. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any text to translate. Please provide the Japanese text you want translated into English.</p>
<p>Here, in the original <code>iris</code> data, the <code>Species</code> cell is used as the axis, and other variable names and values are assigned to <code>name</code> and <code>value</code>, respectively, to arrange them vertically.</p>
<p>Conversely, to convert long-form data to wide-form, use <code>pivot_wider</code>. The example is as follows. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide the Japanese text you want to be translated. Could you please input it so that I could assist you better? Apologies for any confusion, but it seems you have provided a snippet of programming code rather than Japanese text. If you have any Japanese text to translate, feel free to share it and I’ll gladly assist. I’m sorry, but the text provided is a coding script, not Japanese. Could you please provide the correct text? I’m sorry, but what you’ve provided seems to be a piece of programming code, not Japanese text. If you have any Japanese text needing translation, feel free to provide it! As an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m proficient in natural language processing but I’m currently unable to process TeX code or Japanese text without the actual text provided. Please provide the Japanese text you want to translate. You didn’t provide any Japanese text to be translated. Please provide the text and I’ll be glad to assist you. I’m sorry, but you didn’t provide any Japanese text. Can you please provide the text you would like me to translate?</p>
<p>This time, we excluded the <code>Species</code> variable and separately assigned the row number as the <code>ID</code> variable. By using this row number as a key, we are converting from long format to wide format by taking the variable name from the <code>names</code> column and its value from the <code>value</code> column[^3.2].</p>
<p>The reason for excluding the <code>Species</code> variable is because it is impossible to convert the long format into wide format using this as the key (because Species only has three levels), and because it was necessary to have a separate ID to identify individuals. This resulted in the loss of Species information, but this is because the <code>value</code> column of the long format data cannot hold both <code>char</code> and <code>double</code> types at the same time. To avoid this problem, we can consider methods such as numerical conversion of Factor type data with the <code>as.numeric()</code> function.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grouping-and-summary-statistics"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Grouping and Summary Statistics</h2>
<p>By making the data long type, it becomes easier to narrow down variables and cases. Furthermore, if you want to calculate summary statistics for each group, there are <code>group_by</code> for grouping and <code>summarise</code> or <code>reframe</code>. Let’s check through actual examples.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but I cannot translate your text since it was not included in your request. Could you please provide me the Japanese text that you want me to translate? As an AI, I’m afraid I cannot translate this as it seems to be a line of code (in R language, for data processing) rather than Japanese text. This code is grouping a data set called “iris” by a variable called “Species”. You didn’t provide any Japanese text. Could you please provide the text you would like me to translate?</p>
<p>In the code above, at first glance, there seems to be no difference in the data displayed, but you can see that <code>Species[3]</code> is displayed at the time of output. Here, it is shown that it is grouped at the 3 levels of the Species variable. Based on this, let’s <code>summarise</code>.</p>
