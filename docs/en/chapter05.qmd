# Programming with R

In this section, we will explain about R as a programming language.
In addition, I'd recommend @kosugi2023 as a supplementary text. For a more specialized understanding of programming, you may find useful references in @Jared_P_Lander2018-12-28, @Ren_Kun2017-11-23, @Hadley_Wickham2016-02-10, and others.

Programming languages span a wide range, from older ones such as C and Java to more recent ones like Python and Julia. It might be appropriate to think of R not as a statistical package but as a programming language. Compared to other programming languages, R has advantages such as not requiring prior variable type declaration and being flexible about formatting, such as indentation. This makes it user-friendly for beginners. However, as noted in the section on vector reuse (refer to Section @sec-vector), there are some instances where its attempt to be helpful can be counterproductive, such as when it anticipates and compensates for deficiencies, or when it refers to environment variables in the absence of explicit designations during function creation. Those accustomed to stricter languages might find such aspects somewhat inconvenient. 

Overall, we can say that the R language is beginner-friendly.

Indeed, while a multitude of programming languages exist in the world[^5.1], you don't need and indeed can't become proficient in all of them. Instead, it's more productive to familiarize yourself with the underlying basic concepts common to all programming languages, and then to treat the differences between each language as simply 'dialects.' If we had to name three essential concepts, they would be 'assignment,' 'iteration,' and 'conditional branching.'

[^5.1]: @Language2016 introduces as many as 117 different programming languages.

## Substitution

Assignment, in other words, refers to the storing of objects (in memory). This was already mentioned in @sec-Rbase and won't be elaborated here. It is sufficient to be attentive to the type of objects and variables, and their nature of being always overwritten.

Let me add one more thing for clarification, you might occasionally encounter expressions like the following.

```{r, override}
a <- 0
a <- a + 1
print(a)
```

In this example, we deliberately use `=` as the assignment operator. We see `a = a + 1` on the second line, and interpreting this like a mathematical expression can lead to confusion. This statement may seem mathematically odd, but it utilizes the characteristics of programming languages, namely overwriting and assignment. The statement, "Add 1 to the value of `a` (that we currently hold), then assign (or overwrite) this to the same-named object `a`," can be used to employ `a` as a counter variable. To reduce the possibility of misinterpretation in this course, we use `<-` as the assignment operator instead.

A feature common to many languages, including R, is that this object is overwritten. To avoid errors, it's desirable to set an initial value when creating an object. In the previous example, `a <- 0` is set just before the assignment, assigning `0` as the initial value to the object `a`. Without this variable initialization, there's a possibility that the previously used value would be carried over, so when you want to create a new variable to use from now on, it's a good idea to explicitly state it in this way.

Note, to explicitly remove a variable from memory, use the `remove` function.

```{r}
remove(a)
```

When you run this, you will likely notice that the object `a` has disappeared from the Environment tab in RStudio.
Clearing all memory can be done by either clicking on the broom icon found in the Environment tab in RStudio, or by entering `remove(list=ls())`[^5.2].

[^5.2]: The `ls()` function stands for 'list objects'. It's a function that creates a list of objects present in the memory.

## Iteration

### Loop Statement

The main feature of computers is that they can perform calculations continuously without fatigue, provided there are no hardware issues such as power supply. Humans tend to make simple mistakes due to accumulated fatigue from repetition or a lack of concentration, but computers do not have such issues.

Performing iterative calculations is a core feature of computers which allows the continuous repetition of specified computational tasks. A common command for iteration is `for`, often referred to as a for loop. The for loop is a basic control structure in programming. The basic syntax for a `for` loop in R language is as follows:

```r
for (value in sequence) {

    # Code to Execute
Apologies but there is no Japanese text provided in your request. Can you please provide the text you want me to translate?
```

Here, `value` is an iterative index variable that takes the next element of `sequence` in each iteration. `sequence` is generally array-based data such as a vector or list, and the "code to be executed" represents a series of instructions that are carried out within the loop body.

Here is an example of a `for` loop.

```{r, forLoopExam}
for (i in 1:5) {
  cat("現在の値は", i, "です。\n")
}
```

The `for` statement declares a variable in the following parentheses (here, `i`) and specifies how it changes (here, `1:5`, i.e., 1,2,3,4,5). In the succeeding brackets, write the operation you want to repeat. Here, we are performing character output to the console with the `cat` statement. There can be multiple commands here, and the commands on each line are executed until the brackets are closed.

The following example demonstrates a scenario where a vector is specified in `sequence`, and the iteration index variable does not change continuously.

```{r, forLoopExam2}
for (i in c(2, 4, 12, 3, -6)) {
  cat("現在の値は", i, "です。\n")
}
```

Also, iterations can be nested. Let's take a look at the following example.

```{r, forLoopExam3}
# 2次元の行列を定義
A <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)

# 行ごとにループ
for (i in 1:nrow(A)) {
  # 列ごとにループ
  for (j in 1:ncol(A)) {
    cat("要素 [", i, ", ", j, "]は ", A[i, j], "\n")
  }
}
```

Take note here, our iteration index variables are named `i` and `j`. It's important to differentiate the names in this case. Without distinguishing them (by, for example, naming both `i`), we would be left uncertain whether the variable pertains to a row or a column. 

Slightly more technical: whenever a `for` loop is declared in R, it internally generates a new iteration index variable (allocates different memory), preventing errors from occurring. However, in other languages, objects with the same name are often recognized as the same, leading to bugs such as the calculation not being completed because the value has not reached its endpoint.

Shared variable names like `i, j, k` are commonly used in iterations, so it's good practice to avoid using single characters as object names in your own scripts.

### The While Loop

The 'while loop' is a basic structure in programming, repeatedly executing a series of commands for as long as a particular condition remains true. You can intuitively understand this from the name 'while' implying that actions are happening 'whilst' or 'as long as' conditions are met.

The basic syntax of a while loop in the R language is as follows:


```r
while (condition) {
Please provide the text you would like translated, as it seems your message is incomplete. We should have both the necessary Japanese text and context related to it for a proper translation.
    # Code to Execute
You failed to provide the Japanese text that you wish to have translated. Please provide it so I could assist you.
```

Here, "condition" represents the condition upon which the loop will terminate. "# Execute the code" represents a series of instructions to be executed within the loop body. For example, a `while` loop that outputs values from 1 to 10 can be written like this:

```{r,whileExample}
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

In this code, the loop continues as long as 'i' is less than or equal to 5. The value of 'i' is displayed by 'print(i)', and 'i <- i + 1' increases the value of 'i' by one. As such, when the value of 'i' surpasses 10, the condition becomes false, resulting in the termination of the loop.

A key point to note when using while loops is to avoid infinite loops, ones that don't end. This happens when the condition is always true. To avoid such situations, the code must be written in such a way that, within the loop, the condition eventually becomes false.

Furthermore, unlike many other programming languages, R is designed to efficiently perform vectorized calculations. Therefore, by using vectorized expressions as much as possible instead of using 'for' or 'while' loops, you can speed up the calculations.

## Conditional Branching

Conditional branching is a control structure in a program that specifies certain conditions and performs different operations depending on whether those conditions are met. In R language, `if-else` is used to express conditional branching.

### Basic Structure of `if` Statements

The following is the basic syntax for an `if` statement:

```r
if (condition) {
    # Code to run when the condition is true
It seems like you forgot to include the Japanese text needed for translation. Please provide the text and I'll be more than happy to assist you with your request.
```

You specify the condition within the parentheses following `if`. If this condition is true (TRUE), the code inside the following curly brackets `{}` is executed. Moreover, you can use `else` to add processes for when the condition is false (FALSE):

```r
if (condition) {
    # Code to be executed when the condition is true
"Without modifying the R chunk and TeX code, please translate this Japanese text into English:"

(Note: The initial text in English was irrelevant to the prompt.)
    # Code to be executed when conditions are false
It appears that you may have forgotten to include the Japanese text to translate. Could you please provide the text you’d like to have translated?
```

Let's show a specific use case below:

```{r, ifExample}
x <- 10

if (x > 0) {
  print("x is positive")
} else {
  print("x is not positive")
}
```

In this code, different messages are displayed depending on whether the variable `x` is positive or not.

Conditions are specified by logical expressions (e.g., `x > 0`, `y == 1`) or functions/operations that return logical values (TRUE/FALSE), such as `is.numeric(x)`. Also, when combining multiple conditions, logical operators (`&&`, `||`) are used.

In this example, a specific message is output when `x` is positive and `y` is negative. In all other cases, the output will be "Other case". Feel free to experiment by changing the values of `x` and `y`.

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- -3

if (x > 0 && y < 0) {
  print("x is positive and y is negative")
} else {
  print("Other case")
}
```

## Practice Problems on Iteration and Conditional Branching

Please write a program that prints only the even numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Please write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 40. However, only for those numbers that include the digit 3 (whether in the units or tens place) or are multiples of 3, append the string "Sa-ahn!" after the number when printing.
3. Please write a program that prints "positive" for each positive element and "negative" for each negative element in the vector `c(1, -2, 3, -4, 5)`.
4. Please write a program that calculates the multiplication of the following matrices $A$ and $B$. In R, we typically use the operator `%*%` to multiply matrices, but in this case, please create a program using a `for` loop. Element $c_{ij}$ of the resulting matrix located at the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is the sum of the products of each element in the $i$-th row of matrix $A$ and each element in the $j$-th column of matrix $B$, that is, $$c_{ij}=\sum_{k} a_{ik}b_{kj}$$. The code for checking the calculation is shown below.

```{r,matrixCalc}
A <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3)
B <- matrix(3:10, nrow = 2)
## 課題になる行列
print(A)
print(B)
## 求めるべき答え
C <- A %*% B
print(C)
```

## Creating Functions

Even complex programs are composed of assignments, repetitions, and conditional branches that we have learned so far. When executing statistical models such as regression analysis or factor analysis, as users of the statistical package, we just provide data to the function that realizes the statistical model and receive the results. However, those algorithms are created by weaving together these pieces of programming.

In this section, we will consider how to create our own functions. There is no need to be overwhelmed by this. Just like recording a macro when you repeat the same operations on spreadsheet software, if you find yourself writing the same code over and over on R, consider packaging it into something called a function. By turning procedures into functions, you can neatly consolidate them and break them down into smaller units. This not only makes it possible to develop in parallel, but it also makes it easier to spot bugs.

### How to Create Basic Functions

The value that a function receives is called an **argument**, and the value that a function returns is called a **return value**. The expression $y=f(x)$ can be restated as a function $f$ whose argument is `x` and whose return value is `y`.

The basic syntax for writing functions in R is as follows.

```R
function_name <- function(argument) {
The function used here is meant to represent the body of the function.
"Please note that it is essential not to alter the R chunk and TeX code when working with these files. This could result in errors or incorrect data analysis."
Without the context and the actual Japanese text provided, I'm unable to complete your request. Please provide the text you'd like me to translate.
```

Where it says `function body`, it refers to the main part of the computation. For instance, let's try to create a function, `add3`, that adds `3` to a given number and returns it. The code for such a program would appear as follows.

```{r,myFunc}
add3 <- function(x) {
  x <- x + 3
  return(x)
}
# 実行例
add3(5)
```

Also, a function to sum two values would look like this.

```{r,myFunc2}
add_numbers <- function(a, b) {
  sum <- a + b
  return(sum)
}
# 実行例
add_numbers(2, 5)
```

As shown here, it is possible to take multiple arguments. Additionally, you can set up default values. Let's take a look at the following example.

```{r,myFunc3}
add_numbers2 <- function(a, b = 1) {
  sum <- a + b
  return(sum)
}
# 実行例
add_numbers2(2, 5)
add_numbers2(4)
```

When creating a function, setting it as `(a, b=1)` means you're assigning `1` as a default value to `b`, which will be used if no specific value is provided. In the execution examples, if two arguments are provided, the function will perform the calculation using these values (as in `2+5`). If only one argument is provided, the function will utilize the given value as the first argument `a` and use the default value for the second argument `b` (as in `4+1`). This is how the function behaves.

As you might deduce, there are often many arguments in the statistical packages that we users use, and they come with default values. These can be optionally or actively provided. Although you can selectively specify these arguments, they typically pertain to commonly used values or precise settings of calculations and are offered by developers to save users time. A list of possible arguments is displayed when you view the help section of a function, and I encourage you to explore it with interest.

### Multiple Return Values

The return value in R must be a single object. However, there may be situations where you want to return multiple values. In such cases, it's a good idea to bundle the return objects into a 'list' or similar. Below is a simple example.

```{r}
calculate_values <- function(a, b) {
  sum <- a + b
  diff <- a - b
  # 戻り値として名前付きリストを作成
  result <- list("sum" = sum, "diff" = diff)
  return(result)
}
# 実行例
result <- calculate_values(10, 5)
# 結果を表示
print(result)
```

## Practice Problems on Functionalization

1. Please write a function that displays "positive" when a positive number is given, "negative" when a negative number is given, and "zero" when 0 is given.
2. Please write a function that returns the sum, difference, product, and quotient when given two sets of numbers.
3. Please write a function that, when given a specific vector, returns the arithmetic mean, median, maximum value, minimum value, and range.
4. Please write a function that returns the sample variance when a certain vector is given. Note that the `var` function in R returns the unbiased variance $\hat{\sigma}$, and its formula differs from that of the sample variance `v`. For clarity, the formula is shown below.
This is an equation for calculating the sample standard deviation. It is represented as $\hat{\sigma}$. In this equation, 'n' is the sample size, or the number of observations. $x_i$ represents each individual data point, while $\bar{x}$ refers to the mean (or average) of all data points. Essentially, this formula calculates the average squared difference between each data point and the mean, which we then square root to get the standard deviation.
$$v= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$

This is a formula used to calculate the variance. Here, 'v' is the value of variance. 'n' refers to the total number of data points. 'x' refers to each individual data point. 'x̄' represents the mean, or average, of all 'x' data points. The variance measures how much the data points in a population vary from the mean. This equation is the primary way to calculate the variance in a given data set.
